My neighbor has been receiving ADHD meds through the 340b subsidy federal drug program. I also come from a low income background working as a waiter and suffer from ADHD. I am trying to understand if this is program is right for me and curious if anyone also receives their medication from this or any other federal subsidy program.,1,0,0,0
"(title)That particular tool is likely to only be useful for software folk and/or people using Linux. Ive posted it elsewhere and wont share here. I may or may not have ADHD**, but the main idea for it came from being easily distracted by the bukkake of features that most software these days comes with. Its loud and distracting, so I make tools that do just 1 thing and nothing else.  Im building a little software portfolio right now, and <strong>it occurred to me that people here might want particular little programs for QOL improvements. Do you have any requests?</strong>I cant promise that I will even be able to make some of them, but if the right thing comes up, Ill do my best to put something together. If Im going to make stuff it might as well be useful to people, u feel.&#x200B;** (diagnosed then years later diagnosed with something else but honestly I still show symptoms)",1,0,0,0
I refilled my prescription recently for 30mg of Vyvanse and I feel like this batch has done nothing for me. I can’t focus at work and get wrapped up into small stuff that doesn’t matter. I feel like I’ve been on my phone 100x more. After work I’m drained and just sit there instead of getting my life together. I’ve barely worked out and have been binge eating after work. I have no idea what’s going on.. can anyone else relate?,1,0,0,0
"F(22) and I got diagnosed a few months ago and I would have never in a million years think that I had adhd, but my dad suspected me of having adhd after watching an interview of someone who has adhd retell their childhood. Apparently so much of it aligned with how I behaved as a child he pushed for me to get diagnosed. Anyway, I have a huge issue with believing that I have a condition at all. Like, I was also diagnosed with depression years ago, but I always feel like an imposter, or like I’m tricking myself into being depressed so i can feel better about how lazy I was or how cripplingly unmotivated I was while simultaneously wanting to finish said task SO bad because i know i have to and that I should but my body and half of my brain just won’t comply. I also constantly doubt by wondering if i wanted attention or something as a kid and convinced myself of having an issue. Anyway I’m having the same exact issue with adhd. It feels like maybe i knew most if the symptoms of adhd and my unconscious mind answered the questions my psychiatrist was asking me just so I can feel a little bit better about being so friggen weird compared to literally everyone else in my family. I constantly doubt my own diagnosis to the point where i’ve googled multiple times to double check if a diagnosis is given by a psychiatrist or a general health doctor. In fact as im writing this I feel like google isn’t interpreting my question well enough to answer it, and that I’m making a big deal out of nothin. But then get confused because of how shockingly relatable posts concerning adhd has been for me. Its like I’m manipulating myself into thinking im not manipulating myself or something. Does anyone else struggle with this? Or is it just me?🥲",1,0,0,0
"Little bit of context: so both me and my dad have very apparent ADHD (not sure about <em>his</em> diagnosis, but Im pretty sure that I have mixed type.).However, sometimes, it kind of seems like he, the one I <em>got</em> said ADHD from, cant understand why Im incapable of functioning like how a neurotypical person would on a daily basis!Oh, why did you forget to tell us this super important detail? Not sure, Dad, think its because of my short term memory loss induced by rapid thought (a term Ive coined to properly describe the reason I have the memory capacity of a rock to my family members and/or other people)! Well then look <em>harder!</em> I WAS <em>trying</em> to look for that object, however at the same time Im noticing 128 other different objects in <em>addition</em> to the thing that is sitting right in front of me!Nother thing he cant seem to wrap his head around is the fact that I dont have common sense and cant think before I speak. I dont <em>know</em> what these things are, Dad!Hope Im not the only one who has to put up with backlash from someone from within your own team! I find it pretty frustrating when stuff like the above mentioned happens. If anyone can relate to this, Id be glad to hear your stories.",1,0,0,0
"I’m looking for some insight as to what I am experiencing. For the past week, I’ve had some of the best days I’ve had in a long time, feeling confident socialising, not over analysing or being self critical, enjoying peoples company at work etc, followed by some of the worst bed binding depression. A consecutive pattern of up and down. It’s like I recharge 48hours worth of happy but I use it all up in the first day. Now that I’m writing it out I wonder if it’s burn out from university.

"I moved out a few months ago, and since then Ive had quite a few days on which I wasnt able to do anything, barely make myself some food (which probably isnt really healthy). Recently, about a month ago, some friends brought up geocaching, so we went and got a few caches nearby.The official geocaching app shows your streak of days you found a cache, and I now went caching each day for 27 days in a row, just to keep that  streak up and get a nice yellow smiley on the map; Ive successfully gamified going outside (even if its just for one easy cache on some days) :DTo be fair this might not work for everyone, since I live in Vienna - a big city with a few hundred, maybe even a tausend caches reachable by public transit in an hour or less - but for me its the perfect way to get myself outside everyday instead of only staying at home feeling sorry for myself ^^",1,0,0,0
I have this habit of rubbing my right eyebrow (specifically the beginning or whatever its called) since i was very little and its at the point that it feels really smooth. Theres only been a couple strands of hair that have fallen out while rubbing my eyebrow but nothing bad. Ive searched about this habit on google and most of the results are about Trichotillomania.

"4 weeks ago I suddenly lost quite a bit of my hearing and ever since, I’ve been unable to get it checked out. Every time I remember (which I rarely do) that I need to go to the doctor I get so overwhelmed and anxious because I know I should have already gone to a doctor but instead I’m lying there on my bed watching YouTube or whatever. It’s like I’m paralyzed until I suddenly forget that I have to make an appointment. The worst thing of it all is that I enjoy this hearing loss because I used to get overstimulated by sounds and now I feel a lot less overwhelmed. Although I like the quietness, I hate that I can’t understand my friends clearly or that talking feels weird (it’s harder to regulate volume of my voice causing me to talk quieter).I know this is stupid.

"Hi!I’ve (20F) been taking Vyvanse 30 mg for around 2.5 years now. It usually works pretty great for me, but I have noticed in the past 4 months I have days where for the life of me I cannot fall asleep. I went to bed around 12 AM, with the intent to fall asleep by 1 AM I was falling asleep at 1, heard a loud noise, and woke up. I finally was asleep again at 1:30 AM heard a loud noise, and was up for 1:50 AM. It is now 6 AM, and maybe I’m just paranoid, but everytime I have felt tired I have heard a loud noise. My heartbeat still feels it’s shallow and beating fast, which happens, but not often enough to the point I worry. I looked this up and it’s called Exploding Head Syndrome, and it is very common. However, it’s been common for me in the past 3-4 months, especially when I am stressed. I also have days where I cannot fall asleep no matter what I do. I feel very on edge/ paranoid right now.

Today everything seems to be fine however.I know only my doctor can give me a proper answer about this and I’m waiting on an appointment as well as abstaining from everything, but I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience and was able to resume their ADHD medication after some time had passed.

"So in the past few weeks I finally made the decision to take real steps and actively recover from this massive burnout I got myself into in the past couple of years.I got into some new healthy habits and thanks to that some days I even feel a little bit better and less burnt out.However the majority of my days is still spent on laying on my sofa being phisically unable to do any meaningful tasks. I was advised to spend time with my hobbies but mostly I have no power for those either. In addition I have sleep issues, which means I really struggle to sleep (especially at day) therefore sleeping all day is not an option either. This state of mind makes me feel so bored and depressed. Everything feels so exhausting, yet I cannot actually rest. As deadlines in school and the neccesity to find a new job approaching (I am 25), I am getting more and more anxious too.Im trying to be patient with myself, but I just truly have no different choice but to keep going.

Hi guys I hope youre doing fineObligatory english is not my first language and sorry for the long postTLDR: I just cant write. Not even a simple text message/email. Love to talk but apparently to fucking dumb to write.Ever since I can remember I struggled with writing. And by writing I dont mean academic writing per se but literally anything written. Im pretty sure that I am on de dyslexia spectrum but where I live adults cant get a diagnosis (because thats a kids disability right???)This has been and still my nr.1 insecurity and has not only caused many panick attacks but also severely damaged my selfesteem. In school I literally had to force myself into liking more maths and physics in order to avoid writing as much as possible. I did not even try to apply for jobs where writing simple emails or protocols is required because of this dumb phobia. This is seriously ruining my life and the worst part is NO ONE BELIEVES ME. I had teachers and therapeuts tell me that Im overreacting and there is no such thing as writing phobia....I dont know what to do anymore and I dont want to waste opportunities/ my life because of this.I see the irony of this post but believe me that writing this is extremely difficult for me and I am ashamed of all the typos/grammatical erros I made but the desire to get better overweights the shame I feel atm.Btw I never struggled with speaking and actually love talking on the phone or having oral discussions/debates which.... yea would be actually fucking great to convert into writing...,1,0,0,0
"I’ve just turned 25.I started college 8 years ago for an associate’s degree that I was supposed to complete in 2 years.

I’m getting old now and feel more and more alien around my peers.All my meds do is drain energy from a tank I don’t have. They just borrow motivation from the future until one day I completely crash and don’t want to get out of bed for anything.I get close to my target weight and always put it back on before I reach my goal.I practice the musical instruments I play and always get bored of them before I reach a proficiency I’m comfortable with.I try to get back into sports and never play them consistently.I clean my room once and let it get messy for 6 months to a year.I’ve never even held down a job for 6 months or more.I always manage to convince myself that every endeavour I embark on is more trouble than it’s worth within a few days or weeks of starting it.I’m embarrassed to go back to school.

"I am a 25 year old female. I’ve grown up with my symptoms being labeled as OCD, anxiety and depression since grade 7. My symptoms vary from fixation, anxiety and panic attacks, low energy and mood and impulsivity. I’ve never had the classic “stereotypical” symptoms you hear about. I was put on many different meds that target anxiety and depression with no avail. I was diagnosed at 24 with ADHD as I just mentioned to family doctor if I could take an ADHD questionnaire. I was put on vyvanse (50mg) and it has worked for me. My main issue was low productivity, fixation of rituals and napping all day. Since starting my medication, all these issues have gone away or decreased dramatically (unless I skip my meds). I am now wanting to taper off my effexor as I really don’t think I have OCD anymore and that’s why I was taking it. My grades in university have improved and I got a learning disability “seal” on my record so I’m getting extra support. HOWEVER…I can’t help but still feel misdiagnosed. While the medication is helping and I should probably shut up and not complain, I just still question if ADHD is really my diagnosis. Am I just programmed to think “ADHD = can’t sit still”?

"I was in a bad bad way today. I skipped a painting class thing I paid money for because I just felt like I couldnt go. The house and my life is a mess and I couldnt face it. I needed to shower. Theres a million things I needed to do. I couldnt even get up. I felt so lost and guilty for calling in sick to class and truly didnt know what to do with myself.But the impulsive idea of cutting my own hair gave me enough of the excited brain chemicals to get up.So I did it. And it was unclear for awhile there if I had made a grave mistake. I had to put the scissors down and breathe for a minute after a particularly bad-looking snip. But I composed myself and finished the job, and my hair actually looks really cute and Im so glad I did it. And for some reason after my hair was done I felt good enough to do a bunch of house chores. By the end of that I felt so much better.The moral of my story is that I know we get a bad rap for being impulsive... but it can truly be a useful tool for getting out of a funk. When our brains are absolutely starved of the get off your ass chemicals, a fun little impulsive move can be just the thing....at least it was for me. Today. In this particular instance...

"Hello,Having shared my recent post on here, I figured I might as well post an update. I planned to go either today or tomorrow.

Thats why it never occured to me that there might be something wrong. To be honest I gave up on the whole hussle culture and resigned from school pretty early on.

"Long story short, I had to stop taking stimulants because I couldnt stand the side effects anymore. Ive been taking them for maybe about a year now. I kinda sorta tapered off to not taking them at all (I told my doc I was doing it) and now its like I cant do anything because Im too tired and doing anything that requires physical effort wears me out so bad I need like a 3 hour nap. And I can hardly wake up. I just want to lay around and sleep and watch tv.I wasnt this bad prior to taking stimulants. I definitely lacked motivation &amp; was distracted af, but I had a reasonable amount of energy to get thru the day w/o needing 10 naps. The fatigue is so bad that long before I was diagnosed with ADHD, I had to stop drinking coffee then black tea &amp; only drink green tea b/c it was too much caffeine &amp; would make me jittery &amp; nervous.

The premium version of the insurance plan being offered, which is their highest version, only covers up to $2.50 per unit for Vyvanse, and will not cover any long-acting amphetamines after I turn 26.

I’m trying to find some kind of insurance plan that will cover my Vyvanse and more than one doctors visit a year, but that also doesn’t have a premium over $200 and has a low-ish ($1,500-$1,750) deductible.

"Wondering if performance anxiety is related to ADHD (inattentive)? I know that, to a certain extent, performance anxiety is common. But I feel like it gets in the way of things for me. For example, I CANNOT sign my name in front of people. I am an illustrator/author. I have to sign books. If it is a one-off, I will make a mess of it. If it is a long line of readers, the first twenty will be a mess, then I will be able to do it. It is so strange. Ive been writing and illustrating books for 25 years. And still, I dread signing books. It sounds so stupid that I am embarrassed to bring this up!Another example – I am a surfer. Give me a wave by myself, I surf well. Ive been surfing religiously for decades and am very experienced and at home in the ocean. But give me the same wave with anyone watching or around me, or a crowd hassling for the wave, or someone even watching from the beach... I FORGET how to surf! I fall off. I look and feel like a beginner. Its almost like I am not in my body, in the moment. I cannot reign myself in. Again, so strange. This applies to much of my life. With all the decades of daily micro mistakes of ADHD, I have this inbuilt sense of shame that goes with messing anything up.I used to think something was wrong with me, some kind of failing, but now I think maybe it is just the ADHD? Its like I cannot gather my mind to focus on the task. The outside forces draw my concentration in all directions and I cannot do it. Wondering if any other ADHDrs feel this.

"So long story short I was diagnosed about a year ago with ADHD as an adult. Ever since I’ve been medicated,  Ive become more aware of my life… it’s hard to explain but I don’t know where the last 12 years of my life went… I got pregnant at 19 by a man that I was with for only a few months, decided to marry him but was never in love or excited to. Fast forward 12 years and here I am still married to the same man and we had 2 more children together. Outside looking in I should be happy but I’m confused and not sure how I got here… I know it sounds pathetic and there is more in this world to worry about but wanted to put my little blurb out in case others have experienced this and can provide any advice or support. Thank you!",1,0,0,0

"I (31F) was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which has been very eye-opening. I have always been an anxious person with a procrastination problem and would oscillate between extreme productivity and having major struggles to do/start anything. I always chalked my struggles up to general anxiety, but through working with a therapist its become clear that a lot of my anxiety is derivative of my ADHD/difficulty completing tasks in a regimented manner.While I have made some small improvements to my day-to-day by employing strategies learned in therapy and from this community, Ive reached the point where I am interested in trying out medication. My question is -- what are the right steps to take to learn about my options and get a prescription? My diagnosis came to me as verbal confirmation from my therapist during a live session, but I dont have any written record of it. Do I need official documentation in order to get medication? Should I start this conversation with my therapist or my PCP? Ive also noticed online telehealth providers popping up claiming to be able to prescribe ADHD meds.Any advice you can offer on best next steps would be appreciated!",1,0,0,0

Not sure how to go about this. I just had my 3 month check in with my doctor. All is good and he sent my prescription in. I got a text from Walgreens that my prescription is ready for pick-up but I picked up my last one on the 7th of last month. Should I be okay to pick it up?

"Last week, I took 10 mgs of Focalin ER (which I’m prescribed) in the morning after eating food and was fine until the end of my 4th period. My 4th period is after lunch and I ate nothing. Right before I got inside the classroom, I took a 20 mg capsule on an empty stomach with some water. After taking a quiz, I didn’t have anything else to do so I put my head down for 30 mins and closed my eyes. I didn’t fall asleep but when I got up I felt kind of disoriented and nothing seemed real. I was a lot less aware of my surroundings and I felt like I was dreaming. I also had a slight shortness of breath, slightly lightheaded, had a rapid heart rate, super anxious, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I went home that day and felt similar for the rest of the night but had a similar feeling in the morning for a short period. I haven’t felt like that until today where I had 10 mgs of Focalin XR after some food and decided not to eat lunch but to put my head down for about 30 mins. When I got up, I felt very similar and I was still kind of controlling my movements but it felt like I was just spectating myself. About half an hour later when I was walking it felt like I was walking in place and the ground was moving beneath me. I took another 10 mgs when I got home after eating a sandwich. Does anyone know what this could be or why it’s happening?",1,0,0,0

Ok so I finally got a job offer today after losing my job in December. I also lost my health insurance in December so I dont have a current prescription of Adderall but I do take it what I have left over from last year. My question is how do I go about this? Ive never done a drug test while taking Adderall before. My drug test is next week because Im going out of town. Should I just not take Adderall all week for the next week and have it clean out in my system? And not bring it up or bring it up anyways?

At first my appetite was decreased which lasted for a month or so but now went away, so my doc doesnt want to increase since shes worried about my appetite decreasing. I just wonder how 18mg could work for me since it sounds like most people are on much higher dosages. Maybe Im not getting full therapeutic effects? Is it really uncommon to be fine with the lowest dose? I feel sort of invalidated because of it. She did prescribe a booster of 5-10 mg IR once a day which idk why that would be safer than upping to 27mg ER but I was not about to argue with her, she is fixated on my appetite (which is not lowered) and being tiny (I am in the healthy range and petite at 51...)I notice if I drink caffeine on it then I feel like the effects are intensified and in a good way, like I can focus even more and feel more motivated but I dont feel anxious or like Im high.

"so for those of you who don’t play the sims pretty much there’s these bars for your sims needs to keep them happy and healthy. there are six categories: bladder, fun, hunger, social, energy, hygiene. look it up if you don’t know or get it cause it’s kinda hard for me to explain. but anyways to keep these bars up you need to perform certain actions for example shower for hygiene or talk to someone on the phone for social. but if you don’t perform enough of these actions the bar slowly goes down until it turns red and then it’s really important you do something about it. so imagine an app where you tell it for example how many times you need/want to shower in a week and it then uses this rate of showers per week or whatever to act like the bar in the sims and to keep it green you would have to log this action. anyways i don’t really know if this would work because we are real humans and everyone has different needs (water and food for example might be difficult) but i think it could be a lot of help to people like me who sometime can have a hard time remembering/wanting to take care of themselves. it would just be a fun gamified self care app that could motivate and remind you to take care of your needs.",1,0,0,0

Ive been looking into the medications my psychiatrist recommended trying due to history of substance abuse but the side effects of guanfacine or qelbree sound quite nasty. Qelbree sounded a bit better but i dont like the idea of waiting weeks for it to work and a missed dose messing stuff up/and the other horrible side effects also sound bad. So I am wondering if there is a medication that doesnt have a bunch of bad side effects and could be used as needed for example only during schooldays and not on weekends that is least likely to cause Dependance.,1,0,0,0
"My ADHD is <em>severe.</em> This alongside EDS, ASD &amp; other mental health issues leaves me unable to work. I am privileged enough to be in a position where my basic needs have always been met and I’m not homeless. I was just impacted by the stimulant shortage for the first time a few days ago. I’ve been on Dexedrine for 20 years. I am genuinely curious to know how those of you who are forced to work through this are doing so while in active withdrawal? I have expired Adderall from a prescribing error I’ve stashed away for what I call “prior authorization season” which I am currently dipping into. Anytime I’ve entered withdrawal as a result of insurance delays, I am bed-bound. I’ve barely been able to keep my eyes ope, sleeping ~18hrs per day. When I am awake, I am completely ravenous (I literally ate straight butter one time like wtf?) I need to isolate myself from my family as to not severely damage our relationship or become violent if triggered. I’ve broken things from emotional impulsivity. I’ve had near sewerslide attempts. I would not be shocked if I end up hospitalized once out of meds entirely. How are those of you who work doing it? If I enter withdrawal I can barely keep myself alive. Right now I’m medicated <em>just</em> enough to not be in a crisis, but I’m in a very fragile state nonetheless. I do not know life without my medication. I am truly scared regarding the uncertain future of stimulants.",1,0,0,0

"Hey all,I’ve had ADHD since I was 6.  I currently take adderall 20mg twice a day, lamictal 25mg, and Effexor 150mg.  The other medications are for anxiety/depression.  I feel flat and unmotivated nearly everyday.  I currently work as a social worker in child abuse investigations for the past 7 years.  I started back in October 2022 after completing the police academy, then after 3 weeks on night patrol I realized how much my circadian rhythm was getting screwed up which was negatively impacting my mental health.  My wife was also experiencing health issues and I wasn’t willing to put my job over my marriage.  I’ve felt off ever since then.  It didn’t help that one of the upper brass told me I was making an excuse when I confided in him that I had ADHD back on patrol and that killed my confidence.  I guess I’m wondering how much of what I’m experiencing could be related to a medication issue vs something else?  To be clear, I’m not asking for a diagnosis or medication advice as that would be against the rules of this thread.  I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced feeling in a constant fog, unmotivated, aimless, even though I’m  on medication?

Ritalin was the only thing that I felt any different on although it was just a slight difference and didn’t last long at all. What medications work for y’all? I’m gonna list what I’ve tried and how they made me feel.Adderall XR 10-30 mg: 10 and 20 did nothing except make me tired and not hungry. 30 made me extremely nauseous and dizzy, I even almost fainted once, cold sweats and ringing ears and everything. I didn’t notice any difference in terms of the things I struggle with.Adderall IR 10-20 mg- I don’t notice a difference at all, except I can actually eat and I don’t get as tired.Ritalin IR 10-20 mg- first dose gives me amazing clarity and focus but wears off quickly, second dose doesn’t do anything except keep me up all night. This only “worked” the first 3 days I took it. After that, it stopped.Anyone else have similar experiences? I was thinking about trying vyvanse next but not sure. I kinda just wanna give up.

"Need some advice from current psychiatrists or people that have been diagnosed with ADHD. I have had on-going struggle with what seems to me to be ADHD.

I’ve told my psychiatrist that I don’t feel depressed or have anxiety, it’s just I have a hard time in my day to day to function like a normal human etc, and have had so for many years. Is this a waste of time with another psychiatrist pushing antidepressant meds to me or will this result in a proper evaluation?

"Hi Ive been taking Straterra for about 1 week now and feel a noticeable improvement in emotional regulation, mental state, and focus. However it does give me some side effects such as cold chills, sleepiness in the afternoon, slight insomnia (fixed with melatonin) and being more aggressive when I need to be.

Instead of being shy and brushing it off like before, I am now more aggressive and angrier to people who trigger me.

"I’ve been in sort of a low period mood-wise for a couple weeks, and I’ve found that I just can’t force myself to get in my car and drive to the store (it’s always a process with parking in a parking garage and driving in a city), so I’ve been walking to this little market two minutes away from my apartment. The problem is, the market is pretty overpriced, and even beyond that, I haven’t had the bandwidth to buy ingredients and cook anything (the store doesn’t have a ton of actual ingredients anyway), so I’ve been buying a lot of frozen food, prepackaged salads/sandwiches, and that kinda thing. The alternative, which I was doing for a while, was to stock up on cheap junk food and eat bread and Cheetos for dinner or something like that, which obviously isn’t great and definitely contributes to my low mood.

"Hi guys,I’ve been suspecting ADHD for some time now and recently, I’ve been questioning a specific aspect of my behavior. Basically, I feel like I don’t handle social interactions very well with people I don’t know very well, probably because I put a lot of pressure on these interactions. Simply put, I noticed that I have a lot of social automatisms, like saying “hm hm”, “yes” or “ok” to almost everything they say, without truly making the effort to fully understand whatever they’re saying, in order to project the image that I’ve understood. I believe it’s because I’m more focused on making a good impression and keeping control of the social discussion, which is not easy for me as it requires a lot of energy, than on the actual conversation. Its as if I dont react to the information Im given in the present, but to the predefined reactions I have in my head. And I often realise/react out of sync, after I have integrated the information. This doesn’t happen when I’m talking to my partner which was the one who noticed this tendency. It used to at first when we started dating, but not anymore, as I feel totally at ease around him now. Again, it’s only with people I don’t know or don’t know well. To add a bit more context on myself, I come from a family of diplomats and during my childhood, I would often attend social events with my parents and was expected to « behave » a certain way socially and to make a good impression. One interpretation could be that I’m unconsciously afraid to be totally myself or afraid that the conversation would take an uncontrollable turn. I’m not the most confident person ever and I believe this could be a confidence or social anxiety issue but I mainly wanted to know if this behavior/tendency could also indicate ADHD.

"tldr; feeling like an idiot for using this site; I want to remove my information. So recently, I looked into getting an ADHD diagnosis online because I dont know of any psychiatrists near me.

For most my life, Ive kept problems to myself and bottled them up...so I didnt really hold back when answering the questions.

When I read the report two days later, I was very disappointed (and slightly mortified) to find that only two lines out of the report was the diagnosis and the rest was just <em>everything</em> I had filled out in the assessment. Im truly embarrassed to even reread it because like I said, Im never this vulnerable and open with anyone. They asked about everything and for some reason I felt like I needed to answer. They know what meal of the day I skip to the kinds of relationship I have with others. The questions felt so intrusive but I kept pushing through because I was convince this would lead to me receiving proper help in the same amount of detail that I provided.

I was under the assumption I had ADHD for my life, but I was aware that its symptoms were similar to autism. It wasnt an official diagnosis, but my doctor suggested that my issues were likely caused by Asperger Syndrome.

I responded by telling her I did and she countered by saying that I wouldve also likely been placed in a special needs class or something long those lines.

This is my third time retaking the course and I’ve come to realize that I’m too stupid to continue. This was the thing I’ve worked my entire life to achieve and I couldn’t do it. I thought for a long time that if I just worked hard enough I could achieve anything and it always seemed like it until recently. I felt that bubble burst and it hit me with the harsh reality. I am stupid and no matter how hard I try this just isn’t for me. The thing that I’ve sacrificed so much time and energy towards, the thing that I would daydream about everyday when studying, the only thing that I ever wanted and made it my life goal to achieve and I failed. There is no “try again” for me and I’ve come to realize I’m nothing special and never was. I always got close but never met the score (1-2 pts off). I realized that I am just an extra in this world and I should just accept that fact that I was not made for this. I feel numb and at times wish I wouldn’t wake up but that’s not fair to everyone I’ve failed. I failed myself and most importantly my family. I feel like I deserve to live knowing how much of a failure I am. To me that is worse than dying. I am lost and am wondering if there is anyone out there who has come to this realization.",1,0,0,0
"I have a colleague who has previously disclosed to myself and several other co-workers that she has ADHD. For your info, I do not have ADHD.Over the past few weeks, our team has spent a lot of time in person with clients for work events and social events like dinners. During one of those dinners my colleague with ADHD mentioned she has recently been rationing her Adderall because she forgot to request a new prescription. I noticed that during our time with the team and with clients this colleague has been doing things like cutting off other people during conversations to go off on seemingly unrelated tangents, doing a lot of “one-upping” (“you were in the student council? Well I was the PRESIDENT of my student council.”), missing client directives/directions and shutting people down (eg. “That food you’re eating looks gross.”).Clients have been visibly annoyed and other co-workers who are aware of this colleague’s diagnoses have started talking behind her back about how annoying she is. I’m trying to be sympathetic because I know it can’t be easy.I was wondering if you all could help with a couple questions? 1. Is there anything I can/should be doing to make things easier for this colleague? 2. Is it appropriate for me to tell this colleague what I’m noticing and if so, is there a good way to do it that will best help her? 3. Is it appropriate for me to remind other colleagues who already know her diagnosis that we should try to be more understanding?Thank you everyone, I appreciate any and all advice!",1,0,0,0
"I started taking strattera back in January. I started on 25mg for a month, then 40mg for two months. This month (the fourth month) my dr switched me to 36mg (two 18mg pills/day). She wanted me to try taking one in the morning and one in the evening. I tried but I kept forgetting the second dose so I started just taking both at the same time. Anyway, since I’ve been on the 36mg/day, I’ve been feeling more anxious and depressed. Maybe a coincidence, but before I felt like I was doing pretty good on strattera. I have an appointment coming up and was thinking I should ask to try a higher dose. I didn’t think there would be any difference between the 40mg and 36mg but I feel a lot worse. I almost went to the hospital the other day because I was feeling very very depressed and having bad thoughts.I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience?",1,0,0,0
"So. We’re both in quite the predicament, I feel a little embarrassed turning to Reddit about it but I genuinely don’t know what to do in this situation. When my partner is overstimulated from stress, they need space &amp; don’t like being touched or talking about receiving physical affection. When I get understimulated from stress, I need someone to talk to &amp; physical touch or talking about it helps ground me. We are normally very physical affectionate people &amp; just very affectionate in general. This is equally complicated from currently being long distance.

"I was prescribed adzenys for 18.8 mg after me and my psychiatrist found out that taking 2 9.4 mg a day worked better for me than one 9.4. But even though the dosage amount is the same just in different quantities, i feel a DRASTIC difference in taking one 18.8 mg tablet versus two 9.4 mg tablets. So i finished my 18.8 tablets last friday and was off my meds saturday and sunday and now that im back at school and work, i took two of my 9.4 mg tablets but dont feel that extreme drive and elevation like i used to when i took it two months ago before getting on the 18.8. Im hoping its just gonna take some time for my body to get used to it again but hopefully i can feel the increased motivation and focus again because the 18.8 made me feel it much less and im trying to study for certifications and could really use that boost so i can study more effectively and not day dream😭 Has anyone had this happen to them with their own medication?

My 10 yo burns through running shoes. If they have fabric/mesh he will pick at it then start ripping. Eventually the soles start developing holes because hes so active.I used to buy cheap ones (Champions or Fila from Costco) but then thought that spending more would be better (Columbia). They were a little bit better but they still dont last. Most of the shoes I see have some fabric on top. He also has a slightly wide foot and a slightly high instep which can make it harder to find comfortable ones. Any suggestions for a pair that are reasonably priced?

"I’ve been medicated for a bit now and I find that it has really helped me, especially at home. I make to do lists on the weekend and absolutely crush them. But when I’m at work, I can’t even begin projects. I think the variety in chores at home, every task being different, is what helps me get them done. But all my tasks at work while the projects vary in type they’re all the same work. I’m a graphic designer so I’m sitting on the computer all day doing the same thing for most projects.I worked from home a couple times, once when I had Covid and another couple of weeks after having surgery. I did great! I was able to finish tasks quickly and move on taking a break in between sometimes to make a coffee or scoop the litter. I also realize that part of this is that when I’m working from home I’m completely alone I don’t feel like anyone is watching what I’m doing or going to ask me questions and there are way less distractions at home. In the office people are always talking and walking behind me and around my cube. Idk what I’m asking… I guess does anyone know of a way I can break tasks up and take breaks that are still productive but aren’t the same thing over and over again. Part of me wants to ask my boss or the woman above her if I would be able to work from home once a week just to get some relief and to really sit down and get stuff done.

So my stepson (6) is waiting for an assessment for ADHD.Over the weekend his bio mom has said all he’s done is hit her and he tried sitting on her lap when she already had told him politely that he would have to wait until she finished her coffee and in turn burning bio moms legs with the coffee.So today my partner and bio mom are going to sit him down and have a talk with him.My partner who also has ADHD thinks it’s a good idea to tell him because of this he has limited screen time and the iPad will be taken away for the duration of the time he’s at ours (2 days). I have also said we will also need to learn him how to control his impulses such as hitting in the meantime.I tend to pull the child away if he’s getting too rough with me or other kids and tell him it’s not appreciated.Is it ok to take things away from a child with ADHD and what other strategies would you use to learn the child to control impulses?,1,0,0,0

So if I wanted to eat e.g. Im out with people, I just wont take medication beforehand.My question is, is it also normal to feel this type of nausea if I take my meds AFTER eating?

"Hi there,Recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd... unlike those with the more hyperactive type I am not larger than life, bubbly, energetic, creative, really funny, the life of the party etc. I dont always relate to literature where authors will say those with adhd are always funny and bursting with energy and ideas. I do have a sense of humour and can be creative in my own way but when I tell people I have adhd they often question me... they will compare me to another hyperactive woman with adhd and say oh you are not very extraverted or talkative. It just makes me feel like a fraud sometimes and makes me not want to tell anyone because they just do not get it. Anyone else have this struggle? I dont think there is anything wrong with being inattentive but I think sometimes I feel invisible.",1,0,0,0

"Most of my life I have been struggling, unaware of the ADHD monster on my back. (I only very recently got diagnosed)Like many of you, the stuff that was supposed to be easy, never was.  As a female I was the one who was supposed to organize and clean the house.  I was told I was supposed to enjoy doing this and that I was naturally good at it, being a female and all.  I didnt and I wasnt, so I struggled and failed a lot.  It took me over 30 years to develop a set of tricks that actually worked to keep it under control, to make it manageable.  To leave that never-ending stress and those constant feelings of failure behind me.Today I stumbled on a non-ADHD Youtube video that actually gathers most of the ADHD-friendly household tips I discovered during my life in one single video.  Implementing these concepts made a world of difference in my life: - clutter catchers (put baskets/trays/bins in the places where clutter gathers)- avoid storing things on surfaces; keep them empty or keep the things on the surfaces on baskets/trays- get help (with a cleaning robot or service)- declutter declutter declutterI know its not a ADHD video, but the tips she gives are golden for ADHD brains struggling with this.  I know there is a subset of ADHD people who are cleaning-gods; but I also know there is a big group of us for who this is a constant and very real struggle.

"When I was a teen I was diagnosed with borderline ADD, which doesnt (1) ADD exist anymore in its own right and is now considered as ADHD without the H aspect and (2) borderline neither. But back then in the early 2000 (Im 30+) it was ADD and only the focusing aspect was talked about. It isnt until recently I discovered that ADHD comes with a variety of other fun stuff like emotional disregulation and executive function problems, which I had my whole life and didnt know had to do with my ADHD. I found Jessica McCabes How to ADHD youtube channel extremely helpful and informative, writing a diary also helping and having an autistic kid, which is a sister condition to ADHD helped me a lot too in understanding myself and my adhd (and my adhd helped me understand a lot about my kid).

It makes me question sometimes if it was ever ADHD, but then I remember how the meds also improve my Autism symptoms, and how I shift from almost more of an add to ADHD without most of my previous struggles.

When I was in the 6th grade I stopped doing homework. At first this caused a lot of suffering as I’d worry about the consequences but as time went on that feeling just became permanent and I got used to it. When I need to do something instead of finding my motivation last minute I just will start aggressively distracting myself and removing anything that makes me think about it…and then I just won’t think about it and never do it. This has basically ruined my life lol. When I graduated high school I signed up for classses at my local JC and then just stopped showing up leaving myself with an F.

"I dont know why Im nervous, maybe its more excitement? I have never been officially diagnosed, but my new doctor prescribed me 30 days of Concerta (36mg). My normal family doctor wrote me off and said that if I was getting good grades in high school, I didnt have ADHD; this was 10 years ago. I started seeing a therapist at my university and he said lots of my anxiety can  be attributed to ADHD, and after 6 sessions he recommended this new doctor to me. Ive had two appointments with the guy, so he doesnt know me too well. I think Im just scared that I dont actually have ADHD (however I am 95% sure I do) and Im going to try medication and end up feeling whack and freaked out all day. Or Im worried that because he doesnt know me well enough, 36mg is too high and Im gonna have some crazy major depressive episode when it wears off (Ive seen people say they start at 18mg).

"Ever since I’ve taken stimulants (Concerta XL 56mg), I’ve been completely unable to digest alcohol. Btw, I don’t directly mix stimulants with alcohol because that’s definitely not advisable but my doctor said I can have a drink or two late in the evening after my meds have worn off but I’ve found I cannot stomach alcohol whatsoever anymore because my body reacts to alcohol the same way someone who is lactose intolerant reacts to milk…Even if I wait 24 hours after my meds are out of my system, I still have a horrible reaction to alcohol.I get severe stomach pain, nausea, dizziness, sometimes a racing heart, asian flush…this happens almost immediately after just one drink of beer or any other alcoholic beverage which means drinking is just an overall horrific experience and I’d rather avoid alcohol completely than go through that.

Every time that the dose is increased I feel great, I feel like I can be productive throughout the day, and when I was started on 60 I could also be productive after work. But the peace only ever lasts a few days. After that I start getting antsy, frustrated, snappy and anxious. I feel like the doses wear off in 3hrs rather than their supposed 6hrs. I get huge comedowns in the evenings, I find myself reaching for those energy drinks again and making things worse. I cant get to the gym, even though Ive been going for 7 years and normally enjoy it. When I get home from work and it wears off I get highly impulsive and crave risk. Its made me quite light sensitive (I work outdoors) and have some issues with ED as well. Its felt like such a Rollercoaster since diagnosis. In NZ, where Im from, its hard to get one and the only stimulants offered are ritalin and dexamphetamine.

"When reading coping techniques, they were describing a metaphor as your head being stuck in a massive dark cloud, its damp, its blurry, it has thunderstorms inside, you cant think straight.

The point being that you still have adhd, you still have your cloud but its now bright, calm and warm. My metaphor is not a cloud but a motorway.

"Hello 😊 I’m currently taking Vyvanse 50mg. I’ve been taking it for 1.5 to 2 years. I’ve had pretty good results, especially the first several months to a year. Before taking Vyvanse, I had taken Adderall XR. I had good results with it but didn’t like the side effects that I had like bad dry mouth and hard hitting when it would kick in, then crashing when it would wear off. With Vyvanse, it is much smoother and not as bad dry mouth but for quite a while now I’ve noticed that it is not reliable? Like, some days if I didn’t know any better I’d think that I forgot to take it. I’ve also noticed more frequently feeling irritated and getting angry or being bothered by things when I normally wouldn’t. I’ve been thinking about and dreading possibly switching to something else. I got an email reminding me about a 6 month checkin/medication appointment with my doctor in a couple of days so I guess it’s time to figure something out. I thought about going back to Adderall XR since at least it was more reliable but I don’t want to have to deal with issues finding it. That leaves me with trying something totally different and that makes me kinda nervous. I’ve looked up all different sorts of medications approved for ADHD, both stimulants and non-stimulants. That’s when I ran across Adzenys XR-ODT and it really stood out to me. I did notice that it is rather expensive but that I would be able to go to a partnered pharmacy and use a discount card to pay $50 a month which I hate but I’m fortunate enough to be fine with.

"Please leave a comment if you relate to this because I just find it so strange.I take Adderall for inattentive type ADHD and it works fine; it really helps with my executive dysfunction and mood regulation. Even with the med I am typically a sleepy, low-energy person, but when Im without it I feel like Im almost addicted to sleep. Ive felt this way before in my life prior to being medicated and my mom would make jokes about me being narcoleptic. Im not, I just love naps and sleeping in. But combined with executive dysfunction, it feels out-of-control sometimes. Like, even if Im not particularly tired, I just want to nap. I waste hours of my time napping and immediately forgetting dreams. When medicated I dont behave like this as much because it both wakes me up and cancels out the executive dysfunction that causes me to remain in bed. Im wondering if anyone else experiences this? Does anyone else feel addicted to sleep?Edit to clarify: I don’t necessarily feel <em>uncontrollably</em> sleepy, it’s just that I always want to nap. At most I’d say I feel aloof, like I just have no urgency to do anything. I’m not on the verge of falling asleep, I just seem to really enjoy it and find it hard to stop myself from napping. Which I feel like is abnormal, because I get the sense that the average person is so up and awake during the day that they couldn’t nap if they even wanted to.

"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and very recently started taking meds (Ritalin). I’m not sure these are working for me necessarily. They give me more energy in the morning to get started on things, but I feel like I am probably less sharp and finding it harder to access my knowledge and intellect.I am a 43-year-old male I have great social skills, lots of friends and a supportive family, and my relationships are generally good. Pretty much, all of my ADHD related issues have been work and profession related. I like to think I’m pretty intelligent And have a tertiary education, and my career has gone well (I’m now an exec of a small public health org). However, getting here has almost killed me. I have great ideas. I’m very strategic and I give good advice and get along well with people, but give me a project or a task and I’m hopeless. This is led me to experience huge anxiety for most of my adult life as I’ve been constantly confronted with conflict and Periods of failure professionally which have really hard my mental health.I guess what I’m wondering is, do I actually have ADHD or is it generalised anxiety that has led me to occasionally perform poorly and create problems for myself - because of the anxiety? I feel like I am somebody who would do better with something that calms me rather than a stimulant. Very confused by the whole thing.Anybody in a similar boat?",1,0,0,0
"So like I consistently do this thing where my subconscious will loop the last song I heard until I hear it again. This isn’t like getting a song stuck in your head though (I don’t think), because mine literally plays nonstop behind all my thoughts on loop for as long as it takes to listen to it. For example, I’ll be listening to my playlist in the shower and get to the last song and then leave for class. I don’t play music again for another 8 hours, and the whole time I’m singing a song in my head without thinking about it. Like it gets dulled out by conversation, or me having to focus, but then whenever there’s a second to breathe and think again it grows louder. When I open my Spotify and it brings me to whatever I was doing last it’s almost always the exact song I’d been singing in my head, and a lot of the time it’s at the same time stamp as well. This happens overnight too, whatever song I wake up with in my head was the last one I listened to before I fell asleep. A few times it’s even happened where I haven’t listened to music in several days. An interesting thing I’ve noticed is it’s much much more likely to happen if I don’t finish the song because I’m in a rush. Then my brain <em>needs</em> to finish it and the next few hours are agonizing. I’ve legit made myself late before because I had to make sure the song ended before I left lol. But it’s weird to imagine I’m just singing the same song over and over in my head for 10+ hours without even realizing it, because I still get surprised every time I check Spotify and it’s the exact song I think it’s gonna be. It legit happened a few minutes ago which is what prompted this post lol.Does this happen with anyone else, or something similar to this in a different scenario?",1,0,0,0

"I have a medical history of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED), for which I have been taking Adderall 20 mg. The medication has been effective in controlling my symptoms and helping me lose weight, which has been a great source of pride for me. Over the past few years, I have been steadily shedding 20-30 pounds each year.Unfortunately, my local supplier recently informed me that I wont be able to refill my prescription for 1-2 months (thinking positively) due to shortages and long waitlists. After speaking with my doctor, he recommended trying Ritalin and Ozempic as an alternative. However, I have previously tried methylphenidates, which are similar to Ritalin, but they gave me unpleasant side effects like blurry vision and low appetite suppression. Although its been a while since I last took them, I am not keen on experiencing bad side effects while wasting my money. Furthermore, the change in medication would be expensive and take a toll on my finances.As it stands, I have three options: take an Adderall break, which my doctor didnt fully support given my positive progress; try Ritalin and Ozempic together, which is costly; or switch to Ritalin alone and hope that I dont experience any negative side effects this time.If any of you have had experience with these medications or a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing your thoughts and advice.",1,0,0,0

"About 6 months ago, my friend found a virtual personal trainer she really liked and recommended her. I started doing sessions with that trainer soon. Going to the gym 4-5x/week for about 8 weeks. The personal trainer didn’t really work for me since she was harsh in her feedback comments. She would give specific instructions and criticize me for not following them. I became frustrated and started to lose my interest in working out. Then my job at work changed to a pretty simple and mundane task - cue the low dopamine + depression + anxiety. So I have not been eating healthy and stopped working out.I don’t know how much lb I gained but my clothes don’t fit. Meanwhile, the friend who recommended me the trainer is still going strong - following a strict meal plan and working out 5x/week. Even when we met up for dinner the other day just to catch up a few weeks ago, she only had salad while I had an appetizer, pad thai, and thai tea. There’s just so much shame in me feeling like I’m a failure (again). We are seeing each other soon again for a friend’s bridal shower in about a month and I’m already so self-conscious about how I gained so much weight.

"Feeling like an a-hole for wanting to end a new friendship because of how severe her ADHD seems. If I’m struggling with ADHD and committed to change, is it judgmental or hypocritical of me to think she could be a bad influence? I know we should all support one another, it’s so hard as it is, and I don’t have any friends really. But I have my very supportive husband, my amazing kids, and it’s hard for me to maintain a relationship with anyone outside of that let alone one with someone like me… spending time with her has already been stressful at times and I’m just not sure I can be around it or let my kids be around it.For example - one big thing I’ve made huge progress on is not being late. I’ve worked really hard on keeping promises to my kids on this note - we’re leaving for the pool at 2:00, or we’ll get there at this time and will stay for this amount of time then we have to leave. She is always at least 1 hour late (2 different times she was more than 5 hours late, outings with the kids). I’ve told her how important it is to me I know when things are happening and that they do indeed happen when we say so my kids aren’t confused or disappointed. She’s just more apologetic; nothing changes.I’m uncomfortable with other aspects of our friendship too, but I wanted to know your thoughts on just this. How would you feel?",1,0,0,0
"I’m not sure if this issue is specific to BP but I thought I’d ask anyway. I’m on 150 mg lamotrigine for BP2 and 20 mg vyvanse for ADHD. I am probably due for a dosage increase for the lamotrigine, but both had been working well for me until recently. I think I am slipping into a depressive episode and I also noticed that my vyvanse has not been as effective. My procrastination is getting worse, I’m struggling to do tasks that it was helping me with so well, and I feel like it doesn’t last as long throughout the day.

"Hello, I am sorry in advance if this is not the right place to ask for help. I do not have ADHD myself, but my younger brother does and struggles with studying.Right now, he is a senior in highschool and so close to graduating. He is failing a few of his classes, and I really want to help him pass them. His main struggle right now is government and history vocab. However, he says no matter how hard he tries to study, the words just dont make sense, and he cant connect the definitions to the words. Hes tried everything, and most help online is written for younger children. He says writing things down doesnt help, nor does making flashcards. Trying to sit him down in a quiet space to study with no distractions has always made it harder for him, but being in a noisy environment with distractions is just as bad. Most stuff online, like making planners and timers, makes him feel overwhelmed and doesnt help. He says its more about how the words are too complicated and he cant comprehend them. He gets them confused for one another as well.The last test he did, he made a 50%. I tried to tell him that 50% is better than 0%, but he is really discouraged. I want him to talk to his teacher to see if he could do extra credit or redo past assignments, but is there anything that could help him out with the actual act of studying?I try not to pressure him because I know our parents already pressure him a lot. I personally have autism and I dont relate to people with ADHD very much, so its difficult for me to fully understand and help. I thought asking here would be a good idea. I just want him to graduate with the rest of his classmates. He wants to go to college, and having to redo a year would really set him back.Thanks in advance.",1,0,0,0
"I was diagnosed with ADHD from a pretty young age, medicated with Ritalin and Adderall for some years but stopped in high school for varying reasons. Ive had pretty good luck learning to mitigate certain elements of how my brain works, but the one that relentlessly messes things up for me is forgetting/losing things. Anything thats not strapped to my body is at risk of being set down and forgotten, no matter how important it may be. I mitigate this by both keeping everything attached (fanny pack, backpack, etc) and also just not buying overly nice things that might get lost, but does anyone have some good mental tricks to help self-improve this habit? And more importantly...my wife has never been with someone with an issue like this, and has a hard time seeing that its not me devaluing things or not caring. Were wrapping up a four month international trip that I successfully planned and guided us through every step, but Ive been cursed by the little things...forgot my favorite travel knife at an Airbnb, literally accidentally left her water bottle (in my hand...) multiple places on the same walk, though luckily always got it back, and things like that. Last night I accidentally left a nice hat I bought in Ecuador at a fruit store next to our place in Mexico city, but the employee who was there hasnt been in so I cant find anyone to help get it back...might be a lost cause. This ended up being sort of the straw that broke the camels back, and my wife is just really angry at me for this always being at risk of this. Ive tried to explain that its not something that happens out of lack of caring - I HATE losing things so much - but if anyone has had luck communicating with their partner how to think of this more as a mental condition than a moral shortcoming, Im all ears. So far all Ive got is that I wont offer to carry the water bottle anymore, but thats probably not a full long term solution lol",1,0,0,0
Hi. I have just moved to Australia for only reason to get the medicine and find a better job. But the problem is I am not getting the medicine soon. I have a habit of starting new things with high motivation and lose the interest in a couple of days. As recently I thought I could be a car mechanic I bought all the tools that took me days to selecting them because I want to buy the perfect one and jumping from one store to another spent around a week and heaps of money. Changed a part on my car and it didn’t go as expected and lost the motivation to do it. I think it’s because of the adhd as I don’t see the consequences like it will waist time and money and I can’t do it without a supervisor. I even married to a girl without seeing the consequences (and now I am stuck with her)that how will it affect my life in the long term. I only able to feel the consequences once I am done doing something even simple things. Waste alot of time and money everyday on stupid things and regret later and struggle with bills and stuff. I spent days to take a decision and 99 percent I take the wrong one because of over analyzing but miss the simple things. It’s repetitive and I don’t learn from experiences or my knowledge. I am now literally feels that I am a stupid person. My only hope is now medicines but I am not gonna get them soon. What are your thoughts on it? Is there any one who experience this as well and how to cope with it?,1,0,0,0

"To preface, as a child I was put in anger management therapy for outbursts of uncontrollable rage. My therapist diagnosed me with ADHD around 9 years old, and determined that was the cause of my anger. I struggled with rage in Highschool, and it caused me to self harm rather frequently, until I started smoking regularly, and I stopped getting angry regularly. I don’t get angry at others, I just… get angry? For reasons I can’t determine. I’m typing this out while sitting on my couch so full of rage I could take a bite out of my own fucking arm right now. What am I mad about? Im just a little bored. I’ve taken excellent care of myself today. 8 hours of sleep, had a healthy, substantial breakfast, went outside to sit in the sun for an hour, did some weightlifting for an hour, stretched, took a shower, did some laundry. I ticked literally, all of the “take care of the body” boxes today. I did EVERYTHING I was supposed to. And I feel so, so rageful. And bored. But the thought of doing anything makes me feel like putting my head through a wall. I’m not having angry thoughts. I’m not mad at anyone, or anything. But my body feels so angry. My heart has been thumping so hard, I feel a lump in my throat like I need to cry, i feel hot and amped up, and all I want to do is just be fucking angry. But I can’t. That’s not fair of me to be bringing needless anger and stress into our calm house on my boyfriend and my only day off together. I’ve talked it out the best I can with him, and he’s told me it’s okay for me to be angry, and keeps trying to help. I just feel so shitty that I feel this way. I feel shitty that it stresses him out. I feel shitty that I am completely and entirely consumed by a rage I don’t understand. I know if I smoke, it’ll fix it. The anger stops. I just hate that I feel like I have to, yknow? Idk, just venting I guess. Do any of you struggle with rage??",1,0,0,0

However, I have recently started a skincare routine and I’m just posting it here incase it helps anyone else.

For the past two weeks I haven’t missed a morning or night, everything I need is in the one place and I can easily bring it everywhere I stay.Idk if this is the reason or I’m just particularly motivated to help my skin at the moment but it’s definitely working haha.",1,0,0,0

Perhaps I will experience this once the dosage is increased overtime.Reminder to those researching Strattera (or any medication for that matter) and hearing mostly the negative, don’t trick your brain into giving yourself awful side effects. I’ve seen many posts where they where disappointed by a drug, straight up assaulted by it, or had its marvelous properties shatter after a day; all due to placebo.

"Hello. Im probably going to have to stop taking Adderall for a period of time in the next year. Im studying abroad in a country where Adderall is illegal and I dont want to go through the trouble of obtaining some sort of permit. If that goes well, I might not go back on Adderall. Im curious to see if my cognitive abilities worsen once Im off of it. If anyone has any recommendations for tests I can do to test myself, thatd be great. Basically, I want to test myself now while Im on Adderall, and then test myself in the future when Im off of it. That will aid me in my decision to start taking it again or not.Also, anyone who has taken Adderall for a while and then stopped, what was it like? Did you have withdrawal? Did you notice yourself change? Ive been on Adderall for about 6 months and I probably have to stop taking it in around 8 months. Im going to have to stop taking it for a week next month as well.

The first day I took it, I didn’t feel like it opened my third eye like I’ve seen some people describe it but I did feel something different that didn’t feel good or bad. Later that day, I had a sore throat, a loss of appetite, and maybe a bit of anxiety. Day 2:I started feeling sleepy and went to the library to see if I can focus on reading a book but I couldn’t read more than a few sentences. I felt like my focus was a bit worse. I also had a sore throat and a headache at the end.Day 3:My diet isn’t really good so I decided to add protein to my died. I ate a protein bar and protein shake. I cleaned my room and organized it so maybe my focus was a bit better but didn’t do anything else. After a few hours from taking the capsule, I had some anxiety. I didn’t have a headache when it started to wear off.Today on 40mg:I know you’re not supposed to increase the dosage without letting your doctor know but I didn’t feel it was working and decided to increase from 20mg to 40mg. It’s been 5 or 6 hours and I still don’t feel a difference. My throat is less sore than the previous days and I haven’t had any anxiety yet.

"I’m 47, and I was diagnosed with ADHD six months ago. It’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to me, and I feel like a different person. But my marriage is really struggling. We’ve been together six years, married for four and we have a wonderful three-year-old. Like many pre-ADHD diagnosis partners, I was a very difficult person to live with, and I’ve done a lot of things in the last few years that really hurt her - impulsive behaviors, bad financial management, and generally being the child in the relationship. Post-diagnosis, I did a lot of work on myself - medication, therapy, coaching, mindfulness - but I did that very ADHD thing of thinking I was cured and stopped doing all of those things. My wife was overseas for two months with work and I did a great job of staying home with our son and ran our home really well. When she got back, we had a honeymoon period of about a week, and we’ve now slid back into the old dynamics. I find it really hard to be normal around her and anytime I do anything that’s even 1% wrong, she comes down on me like a ton of bricks and drags out all the shit things I’ve ever done to her. I know I’m the one who needs to do the work and I’ve been a lot better the last few weeks - back with a therapist, reading up on marriage effects of ADHD and trying to get myself back on track.

"As much as I hate being late, Ive been late my whole life. Sometimes, I wonder if part of me is subconsciously sabotaging myself. For instance, I know that I cant process the passing of time the way others can, which makes time feel like its going faster than I assume. This is very much out of my control.But once I realize Im running late, my brain will actually make me take even *more* time to touch up my appearance - I might reapply makeup, unfold and refold the cuffs of my jeans, or comb my hair again even though its already been combed. So now Im even *more* late than I would have been if I had just rushed to get out of the house the moment I looked at the time. My theory is that my appearance is something that feels in my control, so when I realize Im running late (which happens everyday), I respond by taking even more time to do the thing that gives me some sense of control.I do virtual therapy on a weekly basis - which has been tremendously helpful - but I always find myself joining a few minutes after the session. I always start the session saying Sorry, Im a little late and my therapist says its fine. Sometimes, she says she was just about to call/email me to make sure I didnt forget.

Stupid question I know I hope I’m not offending anyone by the way.I was just curious what would happen if somebody was regularly taking 40 to 60 mg of Adderall every day under the assumption that they have the diagnosis.

It harmed my confidence with relationships and myself. I had to let her know that ADHD affects more than just school work and concentration.

"Im kind of having a (classic) ADHD crisis at the moment. I was diagnosed at age 20, tried a few medications, decided the side effects were too intense and that I could probably white-knuckle it through life. 5 years later Im realizing that my symptoms <em>are</em> incredibly disabling and I need to do something to change it. I was preoccupied with other physical and mental health issues for a while but now I think Im ready to face the medication carousel again but Im scared. Ritalin worked pretty well but the come-down was always quite intense (anxiety, nausea, sweating) and the actual length of productive focus was only an hour or two. Vyvanse made my heart beat so fast I passed out. When I told my psychiatrist he shrugged. And Strattera made me so disgusted by food I got pukey even thinking about eating. All of this really left a bad taste in my mouth and it made me think that I have horrible genes and that stimulants wont work for me. My mom very rudely told me that if the side effects are that bad then I dont even have ADHD in the first place. Also, I was on the lowest possible dose for every one of these medications. I am very sensitive to medication in general, even 40mg of caffeine makes me feel quite sick. I am also underweight and have many vitamin deficiencies which Im currently treating but I do think it predisposes me to being more side effect-prone. I really need to get my ADHD under control but Ive been so discouraged by my past experiences. Did anyone else need to try several meds before they found a fit? And can side effects become more tolerable the more you take the medication? Every time I told my psychiatrist I didnt like the side effects he just said try something else. Im really alone on this.

"This is one of the annoying things people can tell me, but are they wrong? Yes and no, sure most people wont give a crap if you have ADHD. Society has stigmatized the absolute shit out of ADHD. A lot of people dont respect ADHD, they have been taught that ADHD is just laziness or being easily distracted.Anyway, some context, I am a student who has ADHD. People have told me all my life that I need to try harder. People who genuinely think ADHD is a matter of trying harder need to do some research. Usually when people tell me this, they only mean well, trying to keep me on track, etc. My parents are like that sometimes, but they also say, ADHD is not an excuse because in the future people wont care. While they arent wrong, they arent right either, you see some people really wont care if you have ADHD, but there are people who do care and want to help. I know if I miss a deadline, I can cause problems, but it isnt as easy as just doing it. I always end up using my ADHD as an excuse for situations like that, which is still a very valid excuse.

My job requires me to be medicated to such an extent that I will absolutely feel nauseous and dizzy for two weeks if it means I can keep my job. Will it be horrible if I take Ritalin or Concerta during that interim so I can keep my job?

My husband (29) m and I (33) f recently made a breakthrough. He has a doctor he sees for his medication and his Innattentive ADHD. Ironically this all started with a lie which was very wrong. I won’t go into detail but he fessed up to his wrongdoing at his doctors appointment and we were able to really work together. I’m so proud of him !! He wants to get his CDL for truck driving. Moving forward how can we keep the communication open ? I’m the non ADHD partner and I want some help understanding him better and being there for him.,1,0,0,0

Because like it is making things a lot easier for me but doesn’t it do that for neurotypicals too?

"Hey ya’ll,So I’m a senior in college currently, in my final quarter of school - and after struggling all of college and high school for essentially the last 8 years, my girlfriend and I finally narrowed down that I am pretty textbook inattentive adhd and it bleeds over into all aspects of my life. I recently got diagnosed 4 weeks ago and I’m still waiting to actually start medication because I finally got prescribed adderall XR on Friday, and ofc the pharmacy I got it prescribed to was a; out and b; shady about when they get more and is now c; closed until Tomorrow.Anyway, the point of this post is to share and ask for advice - I’m failing all my classes this quarter. I haven’t turned in assignments to one of my classes for 2 weeks , and showed up to a midterm (for the first time in my college career) completely unaware or prepared for it- i haven’t started any of my research papers even though a draft is due on Friday, and I am missing 4/6 assignments in my lab and my lab partner certainly hates me because I’ve been next to useless.I’ve been struggling to get to classes on time, but the bottom line is that my mind is almost physically preventing me from doing ANYTHING productive or would otherwise help me with classes - I feel an unproductive, intense dread and constantly think about schoolwork but I cannot go through with it. I am aware I’m definitely feeling senioritus/burnout, i don’t feel like my grades particularly matter as long as I pass, and as a result that combined with my regular adhd bullshit is TANKING my performance. Does anyone have advice for combating this burnout?

I went to my first psychiatrist appt today and left feeling not heard. I had a hard time answering some of the questions as it gets hard for me to self reflect on my feelings at times especially to someone I don’t know well. I would bring up examples of why I felt like I have ADHD and felt as if the doctor would rush past those things and focus more on my past diagnosis of depression. I left with him saying he doesn’t think it’s ADHD and thinks it’s just GAD and depression. He prescribed me Lexapro and beta blockers. Truthfully I don’t see the depression part the anxiety part I do but I believe that the anxiety is caused by the ADHD. The doctor is sending me to get tested still. I don’t want to start taking the Lexapro until I go through the ADHD testing and find out for sure. I know it runs in my family my sister and nephew have been diagnosed as well.

"Im aware that I have certain difficulties with heightened or lingering emotions  and emotional regulation in general.  Ive developed coping mechanisms to be better about moments where I experience frustration or anger with my kids so that I dont blow-up at them for no good reason. Recently Ive noticed that when my kids are in any kind of performance, playing an instrument, being in a play, being in a sport, etc. - I become overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude and pride and love - to the point where I definitely tear up and often have to catch my breath, maybe even having to leave the room. Sometimes when I think theres a chance they might embarrass themselves, I can hardly bring myself to watch.  One one hand, I know that these feelings for your kids are normal for everyone and Im just curious to see if Im having a more difficult time reining them in because of ADHD.  But Im having a difficult time figuring out if its lack of executive function or Im just hugely sentimental.  Maybe its just me needing to push back harder against toxic masculinity.  Maybe I experienced failure so much as a kid, without a ton of positive emotional feedback, that seeing my kids triumph is just a huge relief.  Its probably because of all of the above, just to different degrees.The reason Im asking is to see if anyone else has had similar experiences.  Its a double edged sword because I think <em>having</em> ADHD makes that harder for me to regulate emotional responses, but I think <em>experiencing</em> ADHD has helped me be more empathetic. Does that make sense? I take modeling good behavior, emotions, self care, etc for my kids very seriously. And at the end of the day, I want my kids to see how proud I am of them, but I dont necessarily want them freaking out because every time I might turn into a blubbering mess lol. This behavior wasnt really modeled to me when I was a kid and so Im at a loss and would love to hear if other people feel this way and what they do about it.  Thank you!",1,0,0,0
"When I was growing up, in the ’90s, ADHD made me a “bad kid” — I was bored, I talked in class, I was “emotional” and “impulsive.” But like many others with the disorder, I was also identified as gifted, so while I spent many recesses standing against the wall — a truly misguided form of discipline for a hyperactive kid — I was lucky enough not to suffer academically. It wasn’t until I started taking medication, in college, that I began to fully understand I’d been playing on hard mode my whole life. While I thrived at my rigorous liberal arts college, I was met with a new form of scrutiny and suspicion — this time, from pharmacists with built-up skepticism toward those asking for the oft-abused drug.<a href=""https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2023/04/28/adderall-shortage/"">https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2023/04/28/adderall-shortage/</a>",1,0,0,0

Seems like an obvious answer, but I have doubts of my capabilities in this due to my struggles in school.While I have no problem grasping the concepts, I worry that if the topic moves to something I dont like I will lose interest and therefore effort.

Will I even like my occupation? Can I handle the coursework? What happens if I fail, or dont do as well as expected?I am going to have to take extra courses before that too though because I did not take the math and chemistry prerequisites required.Neuroscience is considered hard or something but Im sure thats subjective, as I dont find it to generally be, but I struggle incredibly with math, and only know about 20% of a 9x9 times table lol.I am just worried about succeeding and am intimidated so, I am asking for another perspective on thisWhat do you guys think?

"Hello everyone,Ive been taking Ritalin IR (10mg x 3) for the past 4 years to manage my daily routine(M,29). Recently, my psychiatrist suggested trying Ritalin LA (IR 10mg + LA 20mg) to see if it worked better for me since they cost the same. After being on LA for three days, heres what Ive noticed so far:Pros:- Lasts longer than IR (like its on energy saver mode, weaker but longer) and has a smooth landing. Sometimes I cant even tell when it wears off.- Isnt as overpowering as IR. Sometimes, IR made me feel hyperactive (Im more of an inattentive type), but with LA, I feel more relaxed and alive. I find myself looking for things to do and people to chat with.Cons:- I feel bored more often on LA. Im not as excited or deeply focused on things as I could be. For example, I wont get sucked into coding for hours on end without feeling bored. Im not sure what normal experiences should feel like anymore.- Boredom and apathy were signature ADHD symptoms for me, and I feel like LA brings back the lethargic side of my ADHD.Im curious to hear about other peoples experiences using Ritalin IR and LA.

"To the boy who feels stale and locked: You are confused because you shy from necessity. You feel fretful and helpless because you surrender at every moment. And who can blame you for such frustration? You suffer because of your ability to outwit yourself; it is both your greatest strength and your greatest weakness. Stop intellectually dithering about the nature of your own will. Its literally right there. Look at it. Look at what you want. Listen how you beg - and how you ignore your pleas.You abuse your intelligence by occupying your thoughts with considerations of false conflicts in the spirit of avoidance. You ask Should I be ashamed of this, or should I love myself anyway? without realizing the shallow emptiness of these questions; You allow yourself to suffer, and then you ask whether you should punish or accept yourself for it, instead of ending the suffering through simple action. And what an interesting mind; you fear no flame, yet you avoid the dark. Action unnerves you because it provokes a future which cannot be properly visualized. It bears no face, and you fear that which you do not understand. But take a step into the dark, and you see that the faceless foe has no form. Your heart remains steady, and the ground remains firm beneath you. As you wade deeper into the darkness, you find no resistance, and you realize that which gave you pause never did exist at all.

"TLDR: I get racing thoughts on a fixated topic all day. these are irrational anxious thoughts. My mind has issue dismissing them as irrational. <h2></h2>Hi everyone. The main issues I have with my ADHD are racing thoughts, anxiety, and realizing if my thoughts are rational or not. I get racing thoughts. My brain feels like it scans every nook and cranny to find something for me to worry about. Then once it finds something, it is always something irrational, but I have a hard time dismissing it as irrational. I get fixated on this single irrational worry for days, weeks, or months. It stays with me all through the day. And the rational part of my brain knows there is no evidence of a negative outcome on what I worry about, but the more prominent, worrying part of my brain is louder. Thats the best I can describe it. I am unable to make the connection this isnt irrational. I dont need to worry about it. Its like a radio that wont shut off. It keeps broadcasting the same anxious thoughts on repeat What if.... This will happen.. what if.. that happens instead. And it happens so frequently, I start to believe the worrying thought as fact. My doctor said this issue of ADHD and anxiety is an effect of ADHD. Im already on medication. But we are working on getting the right dosage. Adderall gave me chest pain, though it worked great.

Usually I’m only about a minute or two late but due to the fact that my job uses a swipe clock everything gets recorded and automatically flagged if I’m late more than 3 times in 30 days, which then leads to a write up. On top of this taking a break at work is hugely stressful because it completely disrupts my workflow, so what I’ve done since I’ve been there is simply swipe out for break, go back to work and then swipe back in half hour later. However, I sometimes forget to swipe back in or forget to swipe at all, or I’m so busy that I literally don’t have the time to do it. I’m not looking for advice on how to sleep more, I already know it’s a huge issue, and if I could fix it I would. What I would actually like to know is if there is anything about workplace accommodations and forgoing the need to swipe at all? It’s a huge stress on my life and gives me massive anxiety. I’m an incredibly hard working employee, I get my shit done. I’m medicated and I have alarms set for every half hour and two during my break periods (630/631, 700/701) to try and help me remember to just drop everything and go swipe. But even still I sometimes get distracted or sidetracked with finishing something. If anybody has any info about how the workplace accommodation laws could help me in this situation that would be great.",1,0,0,0
"Hello, I have recently been diagnosed and have been taking vyvanse for the past week. First day was like Wow where have my thoughts gone, Im so focused, but since then Im generally calmer but the concentration is not so great.I am also an ex-smoker and am finding I am really craving a cigarette since taking the vyvanse.

"Hey everyone,Ive been struggling with symptoms of ADHD for as long as I can remember, but Ive been too scared to seek an official diagnosis. Im worried that if I go to a doctor, they wont believe me or wont prescribe medication, even though I feel like I need it to function.Ive been using underground Ritalin that I obtained from friends, and its made a huge difference in my life. I can focus better, my productivity has increased, and I feel like I can actually accomplish things. However, Im almost out and Im starting to feel like my old, unfocused self again.I know that getting diagnosed is the right thing to do, but I cant help feeling scared and anxious about the process.

My husband and I are adhd and I am treated he is not. Only reason is he and I are in recovery he cannot safely take meds while I can. Anyway we do Walmart delivery so it forces us to stay home. We also designate rooms that have to be cleaned each week. So this week it’s our bedroom and bathrooms. Next week office etc…. That way it is not overwhelming. I convince him to do the Walmart delivery because if we go out and I don’t force him to relax he will be exhausted tomorrow. He is a welder and it’s a very physically demanding.

"Im sitting here doing the weekly retrospective of my life and it got me thinking.Last year was a scramble to sort out my life, i was going from a job where i was burnt out and back into studying something i was pationate about.To keep track of my homework i started keeping a notebook with a weekly schedule. The page was a mess of ideas and scribbles, celebrations and confusion initially.Starting the first week i this year i decided to do pushups everyday and to keep track of it, filled in a little square for each day on my weekly planner.Soon after i added pullups to that list and marked out some squares for the days i needed to change the cat litter, eventually i added what days to do laundry etc.I bought some catgrass recently and ive been watering it everyday without any hickups for more than two weeks. I do my laundry like clockwork on wednesdays, my cats waterbowl gets a decent clean every week and so on.I have so many things to do, that ive had to make a printable planner to keep track of it all and im still adding more stuff.I feel like ive uncovered an endurance sport of the mind, every habit i try, every box checked, honing my mental abillity to do stuff and get unstuck.Probably most importantly of all, i no longer feel guilt about not getting stuff done. Because when it happens, i look at my notes and i know why i did not get it done and i know when it will get done instead.<strong>TL;DR</strong> I somehow fell into habit tracking and something similar to the cognitive therapi triangle and the difference it has made on my life and how i cope with my ADHD has been gamebreaking so far.I rate it 5 exploding stars out the milk of human kindness.",1,0,0,0
"Hello everyone, As the posts suggests, I am starting to question whether I have ADHD; this is mostly because I’ve come to realize that stimulation medication, specifically Vyvanse, makes me feel completely whacked. On only 20 mg, I sometimes feel completely manic, my thoughts absolutely race and my anxiety shoots to DEFCON 1. I should note that its not always like this, sometimes I feel somewhat normal with just elevated anxiety, but when its whacked its whacked. Additionally, when the medication wears off my depression and anxiety are elevated making my nights awful. What could be going on here? I was diagnosed with ADHD 4 years ago as an adult, but the process was mostly just me telling my psych that I have all the symptoms of ADHD and relate to pretty much all the posts in this sub (which I do) and then I was diagnosed. If I don’t have ADHD, I certainly have something, or maybe I have a comorbid  disorder that makes the side effects of my meditation so bad? I just really don’t know what to do because without my meds I can’t seem to get anything done. Tl;dr questioning my diagnosis because vyvanse turns me into a manic anxious mess that my friends with adhd cant seem to relate to, but cant really accomplish anything without my meds.",1,0,0,0
I’m looking to see if anyone has tips or suggestions for the situation I’m in atm. I’m have been taking Vyvanse for the past 2 months and has been working well. I had an appointment with my provider and they increased my dose. My pharmacy can fill the script and my insurance will cover their part. However my Vyvanse discount card wouldn’t let discount it till the 9th (the pharmacist even called and asked to override). I have enough of the lower dose till then so I’ll be ok but I would prefer to have the higher dose. Just don’t want to pay like $90… anyone have some suggestions?

It helps me relate to other people who I otherwise would not have anything to talk about with.

"Im 23, diagnosed at 22. I was on a non-stim for a year and before that -- since 13 years old -- I was on a bunch of different antidepressants and even antipsychotics. Stimulants are the only medication that has ever truly helped, my mind feels so calm and I just feel normal. However it is stressful being on them because I have medical trauma. I saw my psych in person (once a year is required being on a controlled substance) and because my weight is low she is now concerned and doesnt want to increase my dose past the lowest. I am naturally petite and healthy and have no issue with appetite but she is claiming I experience appetite issues and doesnt want to further diminish it. This is all extremely triggering and I think I may just stop seeking treatment bc I cant handle the judgement &amp; feeling like no one trusts or believes me. So my question is, for those who have been on stimulants before and stopped medication altogether, how is it going? I somehow survived 23 years without stimulants but let me tell you it was hard. I fear I may not be able function well without them, not only bc trouble focusing and such but also that my ADHD causes a lot of anxiety and depression. I almost wish I never tried medication bc then I wouldnt know what Im missing out on if I stop.And also, I cant switch psychs. I just switched bc my last one quit, so I dont want to look suspicious. Besides, every psych/doctor Ive seen is misinformed or judgmental in some way anyways. Like one said most ppl cant handle stimulants and that I didnt have ADHD if I didnt respond to Atomoxetine. Another said being a low weight was contraindicated with stimulants, and my current one is attributing side effects to me that I dont even struggle with and saying I should only take meds when I need to get work down (uhh, what about my chaotic brain that doesnt just turn off when I dont have work to do??). :(",1,0,0,0

"Background info(scroll down to question if you are too impatient to read it all)I’m 19 and i’ve been on elvanse for some time. Started at 20mg and felt absolutely nothing. Got started on 40mg and was also convinced that i felt nothing but my next appointment was in 6 weeks so i just kept trying. Over time i ended up noticing it actually did work in small areas and my functioning slightly improved. I am better at following conversation with my friends and am more focused in class. But i noticed that if i take it around 7am it would start to wear off at 2-3 ish pm and i would get a crash. I talked to my doctor and she prescribed me a 20mg booster to take around 1pm. I feel like i want to try a dose higher cause even though i feel it helping a bit, when i was methylphenidate 18mg i got almost the same effectiveness. I am going to take the 40mg in the morning and 20mg in the early afternoon. But if i don’t feel any change i was wondering if i could take both the 40mg and the 20mg in the morning at the same time.Question:Is it okay to take 40mg and 20mg at the same time to see if a higher does is better, even though my doctor described the 20mg as a booster for later in the day?",1,0,0,0
"I’ve been taking my 60mg XR Vyvanse for a while now, but I feel that when I complete a task, especially one that takes some time to complete I get this really unsettling feeling that I should still be doing something when I am done and relaxing.

This is even worse if I end up not finishing whatever so was doing. Just wondering if anyone else feels this way. I know I normally get an unsettling feeling when I am relaxing without my meds - but this is different.",1,0,0,0
"So I grew up showing all signs. Ignored by my parents, but it’s made my life a living hell. I have no motivation. Was always terrible at school no matter how hardcore I tried. Was always so messy. Room was always a disaster and when I worked up the energy to clean it finally it would be a disaster again 2 days later. Spend all my money no matter what. Don’t have any hobbies I can keep for more than a day. When people ask me what do you like to do for fun I genuinely don’t have an answer. I interrupt people constantly, don’t listen to what they’re saying. I lay in bed and toss and turn because I can’t sit still. Every task that I have to do in my life no matter how small seems completely impossible. 22 and no license . Have tried and tried but I’m never able to actually go get it. It’s like this for every single thing I do. I’ve tried adderall, it didn’t do anything for me. Stopped taking my antidepressants and anxiety medication because on top of having no energy they made me more zombie like than I usually am. Getting diagnosed without exhibiting “drug seeking behavior” as an adult seems absolutely impossible for me. I just want energy so I can function somewhat normally like everyone else. I’m tired of being tired and I want to know if anyone else has dealt with something like this and how to go about it. I can’t live like this for the rest of my life I’m so behind everyone else and my brain won’t let me go forward. I ignore everyone’s texts because it’s so much effort to respond. I have everyone’s text messages muted so I don’t have to see and get stressed out and think of a response right away. Just tiring. So much else too.",1,0,0,0

I (32f) got diagnosed about 3 years ago. I’m happy to know why my life evolved like it has. I was so carefree before when it came to me as a person. I kinda miss not knowing honestly. At the same time I’ve found ways to function as an adult a bit better knowing why my brain works like it does. I always felt like I was different when I was younger but never understood how. It’s like my whole life changed as I dove deeper and deeper into 80HD. I guess I just hyper fixate too hard about it. I’ve always read people and learned how to mask myself and now that I’m evolving I’m struggling finding out who I really am as a person.

"Hi everyone!I was diagnosed with ADHD back in late 2019 (It was the best thing to happen, finally, an explanation) and was prescribed Atomoxetine in the summer of 2020, I was just out of high school and preparing for entrance exams for engineering colleges and was excited to get on Atomoxetine so that I could study and focus like a neurotypical and get into my dream college.I started the 18mcg meds 6 weeks away from my exam and took them regularly, missing a day here or there. I did not up my dosage as it seemed to be working for me. Those six months were by far the most wonderful time of my 21 yr old life, I could do things at will, and as I was overweight I could finally go exercise everyday and even be more conscious of my hygiene. I even went from being overweight to healthy BMI. It was all rainbows. Even the side effects all subsided by week 4.AND I GOT INTO MY DREAM UNI!However, once I was done with my exam, I quit.The reasons were twofold:1. I believed that I simply didn’t need to focus as much anymore as I was in college and obviously it’s relatively easier schedules etc etc.2. The more important reason however, was the imposter syndrome that popping a pill every morning to function was giving me. The fact that if I didn’t, I’m not the same as my friends. Dumb, yes, but I was only 19.Skip to now, two and some change years later and I have royally screwed up my GPA in the first 2 years of my 4 year degree. I’m at the highest weight I’ve ever been. I’m constantly hating myself and being judged by people for not functioning like expected.To this effect, I’ve decided to get back on the meds and today is day #1! I’m hoping I can average out my grades by doing well these next 2 years. I’m also hoping that Atomoxetine still is my miracle friend, and that I can lose all this weight I’ve gained by starting on good habits again.

"Hi guys,Ive been recently diagnosed with ADHD (F 28) and been on vyvanse for just over 2 months now. Started at 30mg and noticed great improvements in my mood and energy, not getting stuck in bed all day. Felt like it started to get less effetcive at the end of the month so got bumped up to 40mg. Its been great compared to being unmedicated, but I find if Im not working and just at home on the weekends I can get stuck in these thought loops that go on and on. Im not sure if that is the right term for it, but it feels a bit OCD-like, in the way that I keep reinacting a scenario in my head and pretending like I am talking to someone, but keep repeating the story as I keep not getting it perfect... except it is never perfect so goes on and on. Would this mean it is a too high dose for me? Even though 30 felt like not quite enough I also cant exactly tell when it wears off, but my after work life is definitly still struggling, with me just going to bed most days to rot as I like to call it.

"Ive had an ADHD diagnosis for about five years, but have only just got brave enough to try meds. Most of that is because Ive had bad experiences with pretty much every other type of psych medication. One of the more common problems I encounter is when they mess with my appetite. I have a history of anorexia, I am just about healthy now but cant afford to lose any weight. So from that perspective, stimulants are high risk. But also, the ADHD makes the anorexia worse. Its like when understimulated dogs chew the furniture lol, my mind plays destructive but rewarding games with itself when its understimulated, and anorexia definitely fits that bill. Plus being hyperactive means I burn a lot of calories just constantly being on the go. So its possible that stimulants will actually help with this! Either way Ive decided to give meds a go (20mg lisdex to begin) and would really appreciate tips on how to eat enough when your appetite is suppressed.

"Recently started 20mg methylphenidate LA (basically Ritalin) on top of Guanfacine 1mg ER.

Not sure if these get less intense with time?In the past, I was prescribed Vyvanse and also adderall, but found it to be too euphoric and not very conducive to focus. Made me want to call up all my friends and do random stuff.Question is: has anyone found any other medicine that helps but isnt too stimulating?Research has led to modafinil and armodafinil, as they can help focus but do not come with all the side effects and are generally considered safer/less potential for abuse.

"I hate those words more than anything. Literally every single person in my life has said them to me at some point.I recently mentioned to my girlfriend how grateful I was, and how much it meant to me that she had never said that phrase to me before. Well, a few days after i mentioned it I was off my meds and she said I can tell your off your meds, and I mean that as a complement! Idk what she was thinking, I know she realized immediately how hurt I was because I basically shut down immediately and was like that for the rest of the day. The worst part is that she made it entirely about herself and how upset she was at herself for the rest if the evening. Its been weeks now and Im still not over it.

I have pretty moderate ADHD and on the occasional days, when I do somehow forget my pill, there is a drastic difference. And yes, I know she is sorry and genuinely upset with herself, but she was so upset with herself that I felt like there wasnt any room for my emotions, she even slept on the couch by choice that night.

So inconvenient!I got put on to Jornay, 40mg, which I’m glad to see that it is also methylphenidate. Is Jornay anything like regular Concerta?

"Hi, Im a 27F, officially diagnosed at 20. Inattentive type. I take amphetamine dextroamphetamine once a day in the morning and I used to be in therapy, but had to stop for financial issues. Comorbidity with anxiety and depression.My question is, can it ever get better? This evening at like 10:30pm I decided to randomly brush the dog. I noticed earlier at like 7 that his fur was a little rough and hes probably shedding. When I was getting ready to take a bath I remembered again when I saw his brush on the table, so I just decided to go for it and get it done. This stressed my neurotypical partner out immensely. He was worried that because I did it so late and so impulsively, I would leave the hair everywhere all night, say Im going to clean it up in the morning, and then never do. Which dont get me wrong, has happened before, but not every time. I had every intention of cleaning it up right away. Its so frustrating for me when it feels like I can only get things done impulsively or after a dopamine-rich activity. I feel unpredictable, irresponsible, and lazy. I WANT to clean, I want to get these things done. I want to remember to clean out the litter box every single day, but I forget that it exists 98% of the time.Does it ever get better? Will <em>I</em> ever be better? It feels like Im always trying so hard and never actually making it. Like Im just a sad excuse for a grown up.",1,0,0,0
The title sounds really bad. Just wondering if anyone feels the same way or has advice. I was diagnosed with adhd at a very young age and grew up with teachers and family telling me it doesn’t exist and and telling me I’m just lazy my own parents thinking I was emotionless as a child. I had to suppress so much and was never allowed to blame anything on having adhd and now I’m very glad that people who have been recently diagnosed are accepted but it’s hard hearing them talk about how every problem is related to there adhd and I feel almost gatekeepy. I know this is wrong just wondering if anyone who’s had a similar life feels this way.,1,0,0,0
"Feeling like something is wrong, specifically when you are trying to focus on getting stuff done and you can’t.

"I’m a 29F who finally (after years of talking myself out of it) made an appointment to get tested for ADHD. The problem is, my appointment isn’t for another 3 months and the impatience is driving me absolutely crazy. To the point where I’m getting extremely anxious and having crying fits (more on that later) over not having answers. The test I’m scheduled for is a multiple hours long test with a computer and a doctor and it screens for multiple different disorders. I’ve already been diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety by my psychiatrist. However, this is the same psychiatrist who when I asked about ADHD basically said I can’t have it because I have a graduate degree and haven’t lost any jobs or gotten any divorces. I do believe I have the depression and anxiety, but I think it all stems from untreated ADHD my whole life. She’s the one who gave me the information for this separate business that does the diagnostic testing if I still wanted to get tested. She seems to think that my issues that I think are ADHD related (long list of them - I will type them all out from a list I have if anyone is interested) are all from the depression and anxiety, however, I was experiencing a lot of these things before I ever had kids. They just all seem extra exaggerated now. Anyways, I believe there may be a psychiatrist who does ADHD diagnoses but just from talking to the patient and asking questions (no computer testing) who I can get in with sooner. However, I’m terrified of being misdiagnosed because I know depression and ADHD can sometimes have some overlapping symptoms. Is this something you would recommend so I don’t have to wait so long?? Or should I just wait the 3 months but then feel more confident in the diagnosis since it wasn’t just strictly an opinion of one person, but actual computerized test results? TL;DR: Are the computerized versions of ADHD testing worth it/necessary? Or do they seem excessive?",1,0,0,0

"I am currently in the early stages of writing a person statement in order to get referred onto an ADHD assessment. I have plenty of evidence of ADHD specific behaviours as an adult, however I am worried about the childhood portion, which I know an ADHD diagnosis heavily relies on. I did not have a good childhood, between the emotional and physical abuse, I struggled with a lot of things as a child and as a result, I dont remember my childhood very well, or how I was during that time. Wether my behaviour was a result of my environment or potential ADHD. A lot of my memory of that time is blank. I also went through severe anxiety and depression in my early 20s, so my memory from that is also fuzzy and a lot of my potential ADHD symptoms would have been mixed in with that, its hard to tell.Im unable to ask my parents as I had cut contact with them and even if I did speak to them, they dont believe in things like ADHD or depression or anxiety and wouldnt be able to fill out the questionnaire in a way that isnt biased. I have no one from my childhood I could potentially talk to about this. Im struggling how to address that in the statement and am worried that when doing the assessment, that will have a large impact on it. Did anyone else have a similar struggle when trying to get a diagnosis?

He told me if I had my heart set on getting medicated, then I should get testing performed through a neuropsychologist. I met with the neuropsych in January 2022 who told me I had “mild ADHD” but was ordered to go to therapy first to try coping mechanisms for at least 6 months. I called insurance to help finding an ADHD therapist and all they did for me was send a list of all therapists in my area. Finally in December 2022, I was able to find a therapist and was able to begin therapy. I have had a great experience with some great coping methods, but have not been able to get over the hump. Find myself having days where I do not want to get a single work task done, and could not find motivation.

"In advance, this may be long. Ill make sure not to ramble. Im 28(f), finally diagnosed with ADHD. Looking back I can tell I always had signs, I just thought everybody struggled the same. It wasnt until I got out of college that I felt like I didnt have a (key word: expensive) schedule to hold me accountable. I declined mentally and started seeing a therapist again. I told her one of my struggles were my short term memory. That it was so bad it felt deblitating like i was going crazy. More questions more sessions later she told me to get evaluated for ADHD and ta-da. Sounds simple, and yet it wasnt.<br/>I was prescribed vyvanse 20mg, even though my current psychiatrist felt hesitant given a bipolar family history and a twin brother with schizophrenia. I have advocated for my self immensely for her to even prescribe me it. It also took 3 weeks for my prior authorization to even recieve this medication. So my question is, how do you know if youre on the right dose. I felt pretty happy the first 3-5 days and now I just dont feel anything different really. I just hate feeling like Ive had to battle so long for a proper diagnosis that Im terrified of being judged for needing and asking for a higher dose.

"I was only diagnosed about 6 months ago but all of my close family and friends had always told me I needed to get tested because my symptoms are pretty obvious. I was diagnosed with combination adhd and Im pretty confident in the diagnosis because my symptoms are pretty textbook. The thing is, the hyperactivity tends to be internalized because of years of getting in trouble for talking or moving too much. I do talk and ramble. A LOT. But its not all the time. If Im at the doctors office and I have something to talk about, I cant stop talking. Or if Im around someone Im super comfortable with, I think out loud and ramble a lot, but its not all the time. I have times where I dont want to talk at all, even a single word.      I started adderall a few months ago and it makes my mind quiet, but I just talk and talk the first few hours after taking my medication, and then get silent when it wears off. The talking on adderall is way more coherent though, compared to my usual rambling, cant get my point out or remember what I was talking about talking.

"Adderall is listed as a psychostimulant; Vyvanse is also listed as a psychostimulant. The approved uses for Adderall include the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy; the approved uses for Vyvanse include to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder. Its also used off label for treatment resistant depression and narcolepsy. It may improve depression, fatigue, sleepiness and wakefulness.So given this information I am aware that such medication CAN be prescribed off-label for MDD, however it seems that it is generally discouraged- especially in personal experience. I have reported to doctors in the past that when I am on Vyvanse (as prescribed, not during times where I have attempted to abuse it) that I feel more motivated, able to revert my circadian rhythm back to a socially acceptable pattern, and I am able to be an overall functional human-being with reasonable energy levels throughout the day. However, I no longer mention any effects of the meds other than an increase in my ability to focus due to my last doctor who promptly took me off of it after mentioning all the positive effects I usually experience. So my main question is; if Vyvanse is having positive effects on a mental illness that is resistant to other forms of treatment, why would a doctor be weary of prescribing it?

"I want to be clear, Im referring to NON nicotine vape fluids. I dont want to consume nicotine in addition to stimulant medication while obese taking birth control. I feel like thats a slippery slope into a stroke as I get older.I understand that in the comparison of tobacco to vaping, vaping is beneficial regardless of the unknown health risks due to just how awful smoking is...But, what about vaping vs obesity? What about morbid obesity? Studies show individuals with eat disorders latch onto various forms of smoking, so how is the stimulus seeking behavior like mindless snacking of ADHD any different?Im curious to try replacing my snacking habit with a non nicotine vape while working at my desk for hours on end. And hopefully curb my procrastin-eating.Ive also seen people stating that vaping doesnt illicit an insulin response so its arguably better than diet candies or sodas in that regard.Anyone have two cents to throw in here?",1,0,0,0
"I don’t know if it’s related to ADHD in any way but I had vivid visual hallucinations at night until I was about 9 years old, they decreased in intensity and frequency over the years. In my earliest memories I remember seeing Ancient Egyptian-like geometric patterns/figures with vivid colors, or kaleidoscope patterns out of random objects (fruits, plants, anything I can think of really) and those wide variety of hallucinations responded to what I had in mind at the moment. They were quite fun most of the time, but I occasionally had hella scary and detailed hypnagogic hallucinations that would even make an adult shit his/her pants.I wonder if anyone can relate?

"Hi all! So Ive been a teacher for the last 5 years and due to absolute burnout, I am not finishing the last quarter. Im on FMLA until the end of the school year in May. This is also my last year of teaching. I havent been working since the end of March. Im REALLY struggling with the lack of the finite schedule that teaching provides. Ive gone from having my weekdays blocked out to the hour, a schedule that I HAVE to follow so I do my job, to having absolutely nothing outside my house to give me any sort of structure throughout my day. Ive worked myself into a sleep achedule.of about 2am-11:30amish and I really dont like sleeping away the whole morning and then being bored and alone at 1am.

I do have weekly therapy that is roughly the same day/time every week, and Ive started regularly gojng to my grandmas on American Idol nights, so there is some basic routine in that aspect, but my days are just structureless voids and there are no real external consequences for me sleeping in til noon and then laying around my house all day.

I was able to coast on my intelligence most of my life, but I barely graduated college due to this.

He works for a tiny company that only offers high deductible plans which has been awful to try and navigate for someone who’s only ever had public educator insurance which tends to be very good. I was able to start adderall 20mg again in March, decided to up the dose to 25mg 2 weeks in, and was feeling AMAZING until I went to pick up my refill this week and they said it would cost $160, as opposed to the $10 I had paid the previous 2 times. Apparently it cost $10 prior to the end of March because we had hit our massive deductible (by having a baby in February). Now that we’re in the new coverage year, the cost of Adderall goes towards our deductible until we meet it, which god willing we don’t. I’ve got some leftover 20mg that I’ve been taking and I can immediately tell a difference in my motivation and my desire to mindlessly eat sweet treats all day. And the irony of all of this is that as much as I want I to figure out a solution to this, my brain’s not in the right place to do it because I can’t afford the medication that would help me do it 🫠",1,0,0,0

"I hate that I’m not able to finish a tv show. I have so many unfinished shows. I will lose interest halfway through seasons or get sick of watching and want to watch something different. I’ve watched Better Call Saul, Cowboy Bebop, Narcos, Death Note and many more. I hate that I want to watch the best show with my time that I’ll review it on IMDB and make sure it has at least an 8(unless it has an actor I like in it). Then I’ll start watching and then not be able to enjoy a show because I think I’m wasting my time or there’s something better to watch. It’s so frustrating I wish I could just sit still and enjoy but sometimes it feels like I’ll never be able to. I hate that when I’m at work or preoccupied with something else I’ll think “Oh I should have watched that show when I had free time” but when it comes to it I never do what I actually want. This transcends tv but all aspects of life where I want the best but it seems unattainable so it makes it difficult to imagine better and stay motivated.",1,0,0,0

"Hello all, Im making the jump from Vyvanse (20mg) to Concerta (18mg) after I was having a lot of anger. My doc suggested a methylphenidate based drug as opposed to an amphetamine based medicine  to curb some of the mood swings. Its been three days on Concerta and I honestly dont even know where to begin. My doctor warned me that I would need to give Concerta around a week to see whether or not it was the right medicine for me, but honestly I dont know how long I should give a medicine if Im already having side effects. My sleep and appetite are around the same, but Ive noticed that my moods are lower and Im more prone to emotional outbursts. Ive been keeping track of them and they appear to occur an hour after I take the medicine and then when I begin crashing at night. I want to give it at least a week, but Im  losing hope. Ive only ever tried Vyvanse and Concerta and Im genuinely afraid that all stimulants will induce this type of moody, bitchiness in me. So, how long did it take for you guys?",1,0,0,0

"So... its been since February 2020, since I last visited my doctor, and since around May 2020 since I cycled off Adderall time released 15mg. I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD in early 2018 in my mid-thirties after suffering a lifetime of confusion-filled moments as to why I lacked a certain oomph and focus.  After being diagnosed, I was prescribed Adderall for around a year and a half, with success. Both my personal and work life maintained a fairly good balance until around COVID with some unfortunate business downfalls which lead to great stress and created a difficult/stressed mental environment.  After a lengthy conversation with my wife, we decided it was best for me to stop using Adderall as I/We felt it was not beneficial to my mental state, and I agree.  After about 2 years of self-management of my ADHD symptoms, I have managed to coast by, but not make meaningful growth in my personal development. I would think it is related to lacking something some sort of drive, while mentally I wish to pursue personal goals; from Education to Musical Ambitions.&#x200B;So, I am going back to the doctor to discuss and hopefully find some treatment that would work and I wanted to reach out to the community for ideas on what has worked for them so I may bring them up in my conversation.&#x200B;For clarity, I am in a much better mental state and I have managed to maintain a moderate state of physical health despite having a low ambition, I have also had moments of success in my pursuits but lack the consistency which is really what I want to get.&#x200B;I am not averse to going back to Adderall but I would like to consider alternatives. &#x200B;Above all else, thanks for the space and any advice offered.

"Our daughter started focalin at 5 mg which is as low as it can go and she suddenly has major separation/social anxiety. Loved school, wants me to go with her it for her to stay home. She calls me from the front office each day, asks her big brother to come check on her. She has a brand new group of friends and we aren’t sure what happened there which is fine, they are great kids, but just super sudden. And at home she wants us to be together (snuggling, watching a show, outside together etc) all day which I would LOVE but I work from home and thats been very very hard for her. Her ADHD symptoms didnt lessen with this dose so I’m assuming they want to up it but I can only imagine that worsening her anxiety. Does that get better over time? Did you experience increased anxiety when you started stimulants? We absolutely hate this for her.",1,0,0,0
"Hey all, I’ve really been struggling with something the last couple of weeks and I just wanted to try to articulate it all and maybe get some support/ understanding. Whether because of my ADHD or not, I have always been terrible at maintaining relationships. Sometimes it’s because I forget to stay in contact, sometimes it’s because I fall into a period of low confidence/ self-esteem and let the relationship fall off. As a result, I really don’t have a ton of friends. I have a small circle of people I spend time with and this weekend there was a music festival in a nearby town so I went with my fiancé and two close friends. All three of them grew up around here and two of them are active in the music scene, so they knew a lot of people there. I know I’m just getting too into my head, but I’ve just really been struggling with feeling like I don’t fit in. I’ve been feeling extremely lonely. I’ve been feeling like a loser who will never be able to have a good social life. And I know it’s no one’s fault but mine. The hobbies that I rotate between are pretty solitary - video games, sewing, knitting, art. And I can never focus on any of them long enough to actually accomplish anything. I guess I’m just feeling very lonely and kind of in despair. It’s very depressing and I can’t get out of my head about it. I just need a hug and some understanding. Thank you for reading.",1,0,0,0

"(I want to preface this with while I personally really benefit from medication, I recognize it is not the right choice for everyone. I also empathize so deeply with those who are fighting for access to healthcare/medication/mental health supports and can’t necessarily access medication. It took me almost 10 years to be diagnosed and prescribed meds and I’m so sorry if you’re in a similar situation - keep pushing!). Since starting Vyvanse, my mind is so much clearer. I had no idea that my chaotic, “multiple-stations-at-once” thoughts were not neurotypical until I was in my mid-20s. Now that I’m on medication, I can focus on one thought or question and follow it through. I can’t tell you how good that feels. It makes me kinda emotional, to be honest.  I still have the classic ADHD imposter syndrome of being told I’m smart, but feeling like I’m just fooling everyone bc I know a little about a lot of things, but nothing in any real depth. Medication makes me more confident because I feel more in control of my thoughts. Less intrusive thoughts, more curiosity and freedom to explore new ideas.

"Hey guys, my girlfriend recently went from Adderall (20mg and 15mg, XR) to Vyvanse (40mg) and has been experiencing some concerning changes in her mood and personality. She began feeling more depressed and anxious, and experienced what she thinks was her first panic attack. She would get to work, feel overheated and like her heart was racing, throwing up, and experiencing tunnel vision. I took her to the ER which did blood work and an EKG, all which came up within normal limits. Then she cheated on me last night with my female friend. There was a lot of alcohol involved, and she was blacked out and largely doesnt remember it. Shes also straight and has never been interested in other females. She states shes never cheated before and thinks it could be due to her recent medication change. Im considering breaking up with her, as I dont accept cheating, but I wanted to hear if anyone else has similar experiences switching from Adderall to Vyvanse, specifically with the dosage changes (her 35mg Adderall would be equivalent to 70 mg of Vyvanse, but shes only taking 40mg).

"So keep in mind I’m also taking 10mg of escitalopram( previous using 20mg but lowered when started concerta 5 days ago as demanded by psych) also atarax was taking 4 pills of 25mg each a day, got lowered to only 2 max a day but taking only one.

"I take my elvanse (uk for Vyvanse) at 5:30 each morning. Around 2-3pm I get fatigued, have a little lay down, and then I’m fine again.

So I’ll do something that treats that reward centre in my brain: maybe chocolate, sexual activity, looking into subjects of interest or buying things often happens when I’m coming out of the fatigue and am feeling slightly euphoric. I’m just wondering if anybody else gets this and feels like they need to go lay down and then reward themselves somehow.

"Just the question in the title, also how do you know your dose is too low/high?

Does anyone else get worried/nervous about asking for a higher dose in your med? I’m afraid that my Dr will think I’m trying to abuse the medication. I’m currently on the second to highest dose of Adzenys and it’s not strong enough and wears off by noon. I’m prescribed dextroamphetamine IR (10mg) as a booster but I’ve been having to take at least 5mg of that with the Adzenys to feel an effect (I feel like 10mg helps more) but then I’m screwed in the afternoons with only 5mg of the booster. I work 10 hr days so I really need the full day covered and have been suffering at work. I’m afraid if I tell my dr all of this then it will be a red flag that I’m abusing it or something.

I remember it being unpleasant.

"At the end of 2022, I learned the reason for my procrastination, forgetfulness, anger for no reason, and lack of focus. I self-diagnosed myself as having ADHD. Since then, I lost my identity. My whole childhood felt like a lie. Although I forcefully forgot my childhood(cause its traumatic), I realized that it was due to ADHD that my childhood felt like shit. I dont know what I want to do. Whenever I try to learn a new skill or practice a new habit, I cant go on more than a month(for a habit) and 3 months(for a skill). It all comes down to square one. Should I get diagnosed? What if I get labeled as defective(In India, mental health doesnt exist), or what if my family knows? Regarding my burnout, I cant do anything for the past 4 months. I can barely pass my academics, either I sleep too much or become an insomniac, my mind is chaotic and I cant stop its endless chattering. Should I comfort myself saying it is all ADHDs fault and make excuses, or should I blame myself for being born like this? Should I limit myself from pursuing my goals cause ADHD people cant do this or whatever. Should I bind myself to the limits of ADHD? or should I use ADHD to my advantage? All I can do is feel helpless. I request this ADHD community to help me get out of this.",1,0,0,0
"Hey guys, More of a rant than anything here but cheers if youve got any advice.Have a case study Im working on for uni atm its about 1800 words but in 2 days (technically 3 I guess, since its past midnight now) Ive been able to write 500 total words.Ive been struggling more than ever this semester and I dont seem to have retained ANY information about the stuff Ive studied.I was expecting to be able to rely on the deadline to get me to finish but that didnt work, because I went to write and, nothing.It got to the point that I was so frustrated at not being able to get any words, or even do proper research (I cant even get started on that at the moment) that I was holding back tears, pulling at my hair, throwing things and hit myself a couple of times. Really felt dumb because I feel like I dedicate a lot of time to study but I cant recall a single thing. I ended up emailing my lecturer to say it was going to be a few days late and I was aware of the late penalties.Once again, today Ive sat down to try and work on the assignment, I got a bit more done but felt myself getting frustrated again so I decided to take a break. Its been 2 hours and I cant get back started again. Ive never been at that sort of state before out of pure frustration and anger of not being able to do something.Im quite behind in most of my university stuff right now. Im still going through the diagnosis progress at the moment because of a huge waiting list in my area so I dont have access to any medication.Any time I try and talk to anyone about these sort of struggles its a you can do it or just get started or break it down into small tasks   which just lead to me getting more frustrated.Hate it here.",1,0,0,0

"hi i just wanted to ask if this is a normal thing or something to keep in mind as possibly wrong?? I dont feel like my medication works normally and I think i need to up the dosage or change to something else (basically after starting medication and beginning the whole trial and error process of the titration period i went on my year abroad so ive been on only the second dosage ive tried for nearly 10 months because i cant access a psychiatrist here), basically for the most part i dont feel the effects of my medication much when im on it, i still struggle with the same stuff (nothing like those posts that talk about how theyre magical life changing pills 🥲)however i have noticed that on day that i forget to take my meds (or i wake up so late i decide not to so that im not on them when its time to go to bed) I feel like shit. Like emotionally i am just so sad and often times on these days i will have a big old meltdown and feel awful about every aspect of my life, and cant lift myself out of these moods. I now wander is this how i always felt off my meds and this is my emotional disregulation in its natural state, or is it something to do with being reliant on my meds for a good mood? i do recognise that these feelings are VERY familiar and that i am basically feeling how i felt for the majority of my teen years, but i dont know that i felt like this during uni for the past few years till i started medication, at least not as much or as consistently (im 21 and started meds just under a year ago, started uni ~ 2.5 years ago)is this normal and im just feeling how bad my emotional regulation is when unmedicated, or is this something to be concerned about dependance?",1,0,0,0

I try my best every year to work on myself and be a kind and respectful person but no matter what I just can’t find anyone who makes me feel like they enjoy having me around.I have two close friends but they live 4 hours from me so I don’t get to see them that often. And I’m just so terrified that with something like university where people are basically forced to see me on a weekly basis no one is going to want anything to do with me after. I’ve gone through elementary, middle school, high school, and university and developed no close friends no matter how nice I am or what self improvement I give myself.I also started a new job recently. I invited one of my coworkers out rock climbing and it went fantastic. We had a really good time and went out for food after. When I walked her to her car I was having such a good time talking with her I asked if she wanted to go back to my neighborhood to eat more and continue the conversation (she’s gay so I assumed it would be implied I wasn’t hitting on her) The next day my boss called me in to tell to stop inviting people to hang out because it makes them uncomfortable.So now I feel completely gross and dejected.I’m so scared and stressed I actually went to the hospital a week ago with a migraine so bad it warped my vision.I’m in a lot of pain and I don’t know if this is the right place to let it out but I’m grasping at straws at this point.

"Just started Methylphenidate CD 10mg, after a recent adhd diagnosis. After the nueropsych assessment i kept gaslighting myself into believing i was just stupid and making all this up to excuse my failures in college, high school, being lazy, etc. But wow man do these meds work. My brain almost feels too quiet that its scaring me?? I’m sitting here in my nanny families house and it’s silent in the house but i actually hear silence and not my millions of thoughts? One main side effect i have on stimulants is that i google and reddit EVERYTHING lmao. But i really like the Methylphenidate compared to adderall because addy used to give me very uncomfortable side effects like chest pain, dizziness, and an overall wired feeling. Anyways i’m not completely sure if i like the silence, i feel like a big part of my personality when talking to friends is blurting out random thoughts i have and now they’re gone.

Besides ADHD, I also have 4 other diagnoses like insomnia and PTSD.I started at $65/hr in 2016, dropped down every year as I burned bridges and now I have officially earned $0 the last 12 months. Ive had income from a side gig and I show up every week to volunteer a full day - both involve physical labor, work outside of the house and involve a lot of social contact. I have a dedicated office, I have cowork buddies, I have my ADHD focus tools and coping mechanisms.  I got a job offered to me as a secretary in a completely unrelated field.Im in the wrong career.

"I (37F) have only just started my journey to an ADHD diagnosis and have been referred to my specialist team.I have struggled with anxiety, depression, weight problems, low self esteem and severe emotional distress my whole life and felt like I was living in a fog until I was 24 and got diagnosed with depression and started taking antidepressants.They had a huge impact on my life and I could finally thing straight but I struggled with understanding why my parents never got me help. I was always incredibly emotional and sensitive as a child and reading my school reports recently made me realise I had ADHD then and I have it now. Every report sounded the same (too chatty, must concentrate more etc) and all my working life I have struggled to concentrate and felt this terrible fear of forgetting things.I have lost so many things in my life I cannot even count.When I approached my family with the news I thought I had adhd (and so did my doctor and therapist which is why I got referred) they were so dismissive and told me I didn’t want to be ‘labelled’. I felt that old familiar sting of not being heard. Like my family’s fear of there being something ‘wrong’ with me was worse to them than getting me help.I don’t know where to go from here with my family.

"Hello All. I had a moment today where I really considered taking the medication route for my ADHD. I already have a bad memory (losing my phone, keys, wallet) all the time but today really made me consider meds. I sat down at a train station and put my bag on the seat next to me. As the train approached I pushed my bike towards the train and into the wall rack. Then suddenly realised Id left my bag on the seat at the station. I had my laptop in there and im on the verge of completing my I.T Masters degree so it would have been devastated to lose it. The ironic thing is I was actually worrying so much about something happening to it before I left the house, being so close to finishing my course. Has anyone here on meds found that it improves their memory or just prevents them forgetting things as much? Its not strictly a memory problem I know, if I was more aware of my surroundings I think I wouldnt have left it. I think I was just stressed about uni and that made it worse. Luckily a family member was able to drive to the station and pick it up.",1,0,0,0
"Hello, I am getting tested for ADHD very soon and I am incredibly anxious that I do actually have it, if I had to choose between not having it and having it I would choose the latter, but my Dad was the one who told me I was going to get tested one week prior to the actual appointment and I have been nonstop thinking about it. Originally it was to test if I had autism based on the doctors assumption (this was the first time I have ever met the new doctor). It was due to a lack of eye contact, but I have an actual reason for struggling to keep eye contact and not just because it makes me uncomfortable. Anyway. After my suspicions of autism lowered I learned that ADHD and autism can go hand in hand, I have now been thinking back on my life and suspecting I have ADHD, I have a habit of stopping something that Im watching just so I can look up the question I just randomly thought of for example this show was talking about how the character had lost a lot of blood I think of a question like how fast does the body make blood and then ill just have the urge to find out before I restart the video.

"Several years ago I all of a sudden developed an inability to eat and more specifically, ‘swallow’, in public. I was sat with a few friends at a buffet place and remember attempting to swallow only for it to just not go down my throat.Over the next few months I really started to worry about this and moved through diagnosing myself with all kinds of throat related problems. I believed I had an infection, tonsillitis and even throat cancer. I tried gargling salt water (eugh), taking tablets and exercising my vocal cords.I hated it as when I was out in public or in restaurants whilst on holiday, I couldn’t enjoy myself when having a meal as it seriously impacted my ability to be calm. I was stressed and people around me advised I go to the doctors. It troubled me for the remainder of the year so I finally plucked up the courage to go and see my GP. After examining me and looking down my throat, he determined that there was absolutely nothing wrong and diagnosed me with anxiety. Weirdly enough, a friend of mine had asked beforehand, “Do you think it could be psychological?”Since then I’ve still struggled with eating in public, particularly with dry and chewy foods. I find it very difficult to agree to plans with friends if they involve dining. However, when I’m in a comfort zone (my home, my work canteen) <strong>I can eat fine</strong>.Obviously, I’ve now discovered many years later that anxiety is in a <em>friendly</em> union with ADHD and I’ve done a little bit of research on the link.

"Hi Everyone.My name is Cory, 30 years old and I live in Australia.I will try to keep it short but after a long and honestly  exhausting battle... And being hastely diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression (even though I didnt agree with this), I have sought further advice and support, and have now been diagnosed with ADD, which makes so much more sense.I am currently in the process of beginning medication to assist in this journey, I have a regular phycologist I see, but I am also very interested to learn off others who may have similar lived experiences. Some, but not all, of my key areas of struggle are:- energy levels, mainly low - motivation - memory - mood, fluctuates alot - fitness (wishing to increase, but unmotivated) - avoidance- noise polution, it can feel like my head will explode with too many different or uncessaaary noises around me.- self accountability etc..

"Pardon the long post.I am a 19-year-old who has undiagnosed ADHD. Both the diagnosis and medication cost way to much to afford where I stay. I have been following this subreddit as well as watching YouTube videos about ADHD, and I relate to most of the symptoms that everyone experiences.Im out of school, Ive got no work experience and when I become interested in something, that interest only lasts for about a week. I struggle to initiate tasks and that sometimes makes me stare up at the roof all day.I get very emotional easily as well as become overwhelmed at the slightest difficulty increase. This has made it really difficult in figuring out the steps in order to progress in life.I started jouenaling and learning ACT a few days back, but after doing it for a day it began to feel like a hard chore. Yesterday I went online to look at freelancing websites, but filling out the details on them felt too complicated.For two years now, I have been in the house with only my parents to speak to IRL.

"I remember being in my teens sometime around ‘99, listening to my mum shit talking with other mums about kids in my school being given ADHD medication. They were saying ‘Oh it’s because the parents don’t discipline them enough’ and ‘They never should have been parents if they couldn’t handle their kids’. I also worked at a pharmacy in the early to mid 2000’s &amp; witnessed the judgement from adult staff after they handed over ADHD medication, saying shit like ‘Must be a single mum who dopes up her kids instead of doing her job’ &amp; ‘They need to be smacked more not given pills’.I am not even being hyperbolic here. In Australia during that time (and beyond), that seemed to be the general consensus. Kids diagnosed with ADHD were just assholes who needed to be hit more. It certainly was my parent’s opinion especially while I was suffering through my teen years depressed, anxious and completely burnt out. Even when I finally went and got my own diagnosis at 37 years old, my mum was enraged when I posted about it on social media thinking she would be judged.Not presuming these parents were all perfect &amp; the kids didn’t still struggle. But they are still deserving of acknowledgement that during a time where they would have faced harsh judgement, still decided to get their kids help instead of just trying to beat the neurological disorder out of them instead.",1,0,0,0

"Hi everyone,I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and Im struggling to maintain my routine. Before my diagnosis, I had a very strict schedule and was able to maintain my studies (with a lot of stress and pain). But now, it feels like my diagnosis is some form of subconscious excuse/alleviation for not sticking to my strict schedule.Im concerned that Im cheating myself by doing this, or better said sabotaging myself and making my condition already harder. Has anyone else experienced this where they are struggling but are able to cope and then after diagnosis it kind of feels like the weight is slightly less off their shoulders because their diagnosis makes them feel like its more forgivable that they procrastinate and delay tasks?Im disappointed in my recent routine regarding studies and I certainly do not find a diagnosis to be a reason to drop the ball and fall into ways that will be detrimental towards my future self.I am happy to criticize myself and I welcome you all to do the same to me. I will return to the desk and keep at the studies, but I have noticed that recent deadlines have been delayed more casually than I would have in the past.Because oftentimes, Im so stressed about not being able to sit for long that I do a little bit every day, but recently things have just been slipping a little bit. There are some seasons where I just fall out of routine a bit, but I just want to know if theres any connection with my recent diagnosis and if people have also experienced this self-sabotaging response post-diagnosis.If anyone is experiencing this as well, know that youll get through it and you will always be able to find a routine with enough dedication and support.I certainly dont want to reduce my current tasks but I just want to put out my ideas and hypothesis about my recent behavior and identify whether this is just me making things up in my mind or if others have also experienced this.Thank you for reading!",1,0,0,0

By no means am I a good gardener, but I grow veg, and keep grass tidy.I’ve always done this.  However, pre diagnosis, even going back 50 years, I would go to the garden start weeding, 15 mins later stop for a drink or whatever, start chatting without thinking to whoever was there, then probably open a bag of seeds then go inside to rolling eyes and the “Dave is finished”.  40 / 50 years of this.then diagnosis and meds.2 months in.

"So I have used 2 different medicines for my adhd that was really bad for me. Vyvanse and concerta. Vyvanse was ok for a while, it worried me a bit because it seemed as if my personality was gone but I seemed to be able to lock in my focus and do chores easy. However I had bad depression and suicidal thoughts on the come downs at night, never the impulse to kill myself, just thoughts that Id be better dead and never will amount to anything. Concerta was similar, but Id get really really really bad headaches that had nothing to do with hydration, I suspect it had to do with blood pressure (Im really overweight). so I havent tried Adderall at all although its the most common, physicians dont like prescribing it due to likelihood of abuse.

"Hi all. I’m after some support and advice on how best to support my daughter, 12 (almost 13). She is in her first year of high school (which is a new school she started at in February - we’re in Australia.) She was diagnosed with adhd at age 7 and is medicated with Ritalin. She has a paed who we see twice a year. The main issue is that she is struggling a lot with friendship groups - she did okish during primary school (but her friendships weren’t massively stable). This year had been a bit of a disaster - she has been asked to leave two friendship groups now, the latest just yesterday, and she has been just completely hysterical. It’s been devastating for her. The other girls told her that she is too quiet, comes across as a bit rude, and is boring because she has no interests, which is true, she doesn’t. My heart breaks for her - I have tried a range of things to get her involved in (hockey, swimming, dance etc) but she doesn’t like structured activities. She finds them incredibly stressful and overwhelming. The only thing she likes to do is play on her phone or play things like Roblox. I think she has trouble with being appropriate in her communications - I suspect she annoys her friends by messaging too much. Her dad and I have decided that we have to make her get involved so we’ve enrolled her in a drama class and we’re looking at tennis lessons. We are also going to massively limit the time on her devices - I’ve always let her have her devices because I’ve read it can be how she decompresses. Is there anything else I can do to help her? My niece sees an occupational therapist for her adhd and she says that helps - does anyone have any experience with this? Any other ideas or suggestions would be very welcome.

"The semester is coming to a close and I have WAY too much catch-up work to do. Two pals generously offered to help by taking on an assignment for me, as I am at risk of failing this class.I printed out the instructions for each of the assignments I have to do (theyre for a computer program all 3 of us use) and layed them out so my dear pals could choose their favorite.

Hi everyone! Love this community.So I’ve been prescribed 20mg of Vyvanse. First couple of days I would say I’ve felt very ‘wired’ and there have been moments where I’ve had to stop and just breath. I take my meds at 6pm in the morning and by 8am I can feel the medication starting to do it’s job though come 10am it really kicks in and like I said I feel very ‘wired’ and to me it’s quite uncomfortable.I’ve been eating breakfast and also having a coffee in the morning. Does coffee also play a roll in me feeling very ‘wired’ on Vyvanse does it make it worse? Basically I’m asking has anyone ever felt like when they first started taking Vyvanse it was a real shock to the system and the medication felt very strong?All in all. It was doing its job and Ive felt great. Very focused and motivated. Just a little too ‘wired’ I must say haha!Thank you!!,1,0,0,0

I have had two different therapists confirm that they believe I have it but due to living in the UK the wait list to get diagnosed on the NHS is years as an adult.

"edit: I should add that I’m 20, and this was my first long-term relationship, which why I have no map for this. I recently broke things off with my boyfriend of almost two years. It was mutual but I instigated, and I think that has made it harder. It’s a very acute sense of grief, and while I feel most of the time that I made the right decision, it’s killing me knowing that if I texted him and told him how much I missed him, we might be able to try again.

Has anyone felt a noticeable difference between the last few pills of a refill vs better stimulation from a fresh new refill?My prescription is branded Dexedrine Spansule 15mg (by Paladin Labs) taking for the past 3 years, two times a day. I keep them in their original container away from sunlight. My last refill was for 90 days which I am almost finished with. I am not satisfied with the stimulating effect that these 3month old capsules are giving (or maybe my body is craving a higher dose?). So, now I am switching to generic Dexedrine SR 15mg (by Teva). I also noticed this difference in the past when I received a 6-month prescription of Dexedrine Spansule 15mg prescription to take overseas when the pandemic hit.On a side note: I also experienced that my productivity is better on generic versions of Dexedrine both long-acting and immediate release by Teva compared to the branded ones by Paladin. So thats another reason why I am switching to generic. Could it be that my body has gotten used to the branded ones by Paladin taken over the last 3 years?",1,0,0,0
"I (22f) got diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago, and I’m starting the process of finding a medication that works for me. I’ve had an idea that I’ve had it for a couple years now, but now that im actually diagnosed Im kind of going through a denial/needing validation of my symptoms. I keep thinking about how I was as a child and if I had symptoms, why didn’t anyone do anything to help me? I’ve been struggling so much ever since high school and nobody that knows me well has EVER suggested seeing a psychiatrist or even researching ADHD, and this makes me feel imposter syndrome about it (MY DAD IS A PSYCH WHO HAS ADHD ??) I try to think about what my symptoms would’ve looked like as a child and I didn’t have the typical issues with forgetting homework in school or not being able to find something in my backpack. I feel like my symptoms are more in my head with how I feel/react to my environment and how I function. I just kind of want support from people who have symptoms that don’t quite match up with the “typical” or hallmark symptoms and presentations that ADHD is known for. I know I just rambled a bit but if anyone has anything to say about anything I said it would be greatly appreciated. :)",1,0,0,0

We explored how wearing an eye mask to block light during overnight sleep impacts memory and alertness, changes that could benefit everyday tasks like studying or driving. In Experiment 1, ninety-four 18–35-year-olds wore an eye mask while they slept every night for a week and underwent a control condition in which light was not blocked for another week. Five habituation nights were followed by a cognitive battery on the sixth and seventh days. This revealed superior episodic encoding and an improvement on alertness when using the mask. In Experiment 2, thirty-five 18–35-year-olds used a wearable device to monitor sleep with and without the mask. This replicated the encoding benefit and showed that it was predicted by time spent in slow-wave sleep. Our findings suggest that wearing an eye mask during overnight sleep can improve episodic encoding and alertness the next day.",1,0,0,0

"I am prescribed thirty 10mg IR Adderall every month.  I refill at Pharmacy A, which allows me to fill two days early each month (on the 28th day).  Two days is the max, and they won’t fill any prescription before the 28th day.

"Hi, so I have ADHD and was previously taking Lexapro and Adderall for several years. At first, the Lexapro worked for me, but in the past 3 years or so it had been making me feel pretty anhedonic, so I spent a few months going off of it (which sucked). With just the Adderall, my mental health was pretty good, but its always given me bad physical side effects.

Im so tired, I have no energy at all and my executive function is much worse. Ive also been very sad, constantly, for no good reason. Not just anhedonia but crying all the time about random things and feeling like I have no future, like everything in my life is going wrong, even though I felt the opposite just a week ago. And I cant focus on anything, so work is very difficult. But its only been a week, so before I talk to my psych, I wanted to ask reddit if this is normal.

But honestly? Haven’t noticed any difference, like at all. Not even side affects.Maybe this physical fatigue could be a side affect of the meds, but I’ve had this for ages. Really I thought it was a symptom of adhd but recently I’ve been wondering if it’s not related at all? Idk are you guys weak? Maybe it’s just because I’m not great at having routine/executive functioning that it’s making my physical health suffer?",1,0,0,0

"hi . i realize I need a better organization system for my ideas and general thoughts of things coming up in the future. i will write down whatever comes into my brain in my notes app and it ends up accumulating into multiple lists of to dos that span from this week to the next few months and it gets really overwhelming. Has anyone found a good way to 1. Organize their brain / ideas (love my adhd brain for the ideas or produces but the quantity and worry ab getting them all done is overwhelming) and 2. Put their ideas they write down into action instead of continuously writing down things to do instead of just doing them right then (for example I just wrote that I want to print out photos that inspire me to put in a notebook for future project brainstorming and inspiration as I’m a photography student, but instead of doing it rn I’m only focused on getting my most urgent things of the day done.

"TL;DR: I went for an unusual run with my dog this morning because the sun was finally out, and I felt as energized as I did after taking my meds! So much so that I forgot to take them because my usual grogginess was gone.I’ve been curious about the relationship between exercise and ADHD. I’ve never done sports but I used to love playgrounds, climbings trees and jumping off high platforms as a kid. Now as an adult I found myself bored with most forms of exercise (jogging, gym, weights, etc). But remembering my childhood has made me want to look for similar forms of exercise like the ones I enjoyed. If anyone has any suggestions (cheap ones too please) let me know :) I have started going to playgrounds recently, climbing, doing the monkey bars, but I feel like Will Ferrel on Elf.I also spoke with some friends who have ADHD and they mentioned how important exercise is for them. We weren’t even talking about ADHD and both of them mentioned how they feel worse physically, mentally, and emotionally if they stop working out even for a week. The habit of working out continuously is hard to upkeep but it’s absence is almost immediately felt.Can anyone else relate? Exercise is a no brainer, but I honestly never considered how important it can be for ADHD brains, from getting us out of rumination, externalizing our ever-present hyperactivity to potentially calming down our nervous system.",1,0,0,0

During meetings, especially when I have to speak, I get nervous and my heart starts to race, but not this recent time around. Just speaking in general outside of a meeting can make me feel that way, but lately Ive felt less anxious during those interactions. Another example... I was listening to music with my headphones on while working from home at my computer, and my girlfriend unexpectedly came up behind me and touched my shoulder. Normally, this would have scared the hell out of me and I would have flinched or jolted my body in some way, but not this time while on this medication.

"I’m recently diagnosed and taking Vyvanse, however it was just a questionnaire from my family doctor with no further probing.Going to try and make this as short as possible which will be hard.I don’t present as the typical adhd person, I barely present at all because I (think I) use my anxiety to focus on stuff. Basically as long as I literally give myself anxiety, it doesn’t have to be about anything specific, I can almost entirely eliminate the typical adhd symptoms which has made some people around me question the diagnosis, rightfully so, as someone in school randomly gets adhd medication that doesn’t look like they have adhd I would likely question as well. Anyways, I’ve had the ability to not be anxious but I simply choose not to because if I didn’t everything would fall apart which it has, does, and will. Does anyone have the same experience as me? Should I stop saying I have adhd if someone asks? It really just fucking sucks because I’m put in this situation where I’m just being torn apart between having horrible anxiety and keeping a job or getting assignments done. If someone does have the same experience, does medication allow you to do stuff without needing to walk a tightrope? So far I haven’t felt like it helped with constant stupid mistakes and general symptoms when I don’t make myself uncomfortable.PS I’m trying to find a specialist to get a more solid diagnosis but that won’t happen for a few months.",1,0,0,0
"I need to preface this post by mentioning Im going to speak to my doctor about this and if the situation gets worse Im heading to Urgent Care. Ive been experiencing overstimulation for almost two months now, usually they kick in near the end of the day when I became easily overwhelmed and hearing someone speak can cause me physical pain. I just feel like I want an hour or two to be in a totally silent place. I have loving people around who support me and are more than willing to give me what I need, and at times may cut me slack when Im getting easily irritated. Recently I started a new job, it is a promotion and Im very happy with it, but it is a highly stressful role. My desk is in a noisy busy floor and I have people come my way from all four directions. Fast forward to this week, Im not only getting easily irritated and need a couple of hours to myself anymore, but my body is getting sick. Chest tightness, headache, anger, dizziness, and muscles dystonia. At times I feel like I will pass out, my entire body gets very uncomfortable and my fingers and toes move on their own. I lose track of time, I zone out suddenly and at times stop mid sentence. It is a state I never experienced before, and it is overwhelming. It is not a minor thing that can be fixed with a few breathing exercises.I did start therapy recently as well and with it a lot of past trauma is being brought up, and will start EMDR next week, so that could have something to do with it.Im more than tired and frustrated. I thought getting my ADHD medicated will make life easier for me, and it sure did, but now what? I cant function in a noisy environment? I used to do that for years without any problem, and 6 months after starting treatment I suddenly cant? Is treating ADHD even helping at this point? And I dont think I have autism. I dont meet a lot of the criteria to be diagnoses with it. Im on the verge of throwing away all my medications at this point. Anyone experienced something like this?",1,0,0,0

Usually on the phone calls, I discuss things about their career improvement, health and well being. But as soon as the call ends, I feel extreme anxiety, I feel like what I said was stupid or I shouldn’t have said it. I know these are silly thoughts, but my brain isn’t understanding this.

"Hello!Since i was a kid people have always said i have poor peripheral vision. I constantly walk into the edges of counters, coffee tables, i stub my toes multiple times a day, i fall going both up and down the stairs, and i trip over my cats fairly regularly. I do wear glasses, which may have something to do with this, but i feel like what is happening is that i am so focused on my mission (or im walking while daydreaming) that i put navigation on autopilot and stop actually paying attention to my surroundings.My legs and feet are covered in bruises, i am im pretty much constant pain from the waist down, and this can make driving and operating a bike basically impossible.I dont feel like there is something wrong with my eyes, if i am not walking i am actually extremely sensitive to what is happening in my peripheral vision, and when i am walking in rough terrain i am fine. Also- i have no issues when roller blading! The people in my life want me to get this issue checked out by a doctor, but they also do not really understand when i try to explain how this ONLY happens when I am not 100% focused on walking. I have poorly memorized where everything sits in my house and will revert to this poor internal navigation system constantly instead of watching where i am going. When i am new to a job i never run in to things, but once the basic layout of the building is memorized i start having the same problem all over again.I am curious if anyone else with ADHD has this issue, it really FEELS like it is my adhd, this is also the sort of mindset i am in when i set things down in extremely stupid places and then have to spend 30 minutes looking for them.

I remember just getting so humiliated and embarrassed I would tear up or even start crying and I would then get yelled at for crying. I would often hear things like you did so well on this test, why wont you just apply yourself in the same way to assignments or homework? My grandparents, who were my guardians at the time, didnt fully understand ADHD or really any other mental illness, so a lot of signs and symptoms were just chalked up as me being lazy or not willing to apply myself. Or, when I did apply myself, which I now realize was me hyperfocusing on something I loved (which was books/reading/writing) I was a super smart overachiever, so there couldnt possibly be anything wrong with me.

I’ve been taking 18 mg for like 5 days I think, and I managed to low my AD from 20mg to 10(lexapro) and manage also to go from taking 4 pills of atarax a day, one every 4 hours(25mg each pill) to take only one in the morning.. my main problem was anxiety and panic attacks which atarax absolutely helped more than the AD itself imo. So idk what to think of this. Because I feel better but not at 100%. Keep in mind like 2 and a half years ago I was kinda diagnosed with depression/anxiety and been taking ad’s, xanax and also atarax on and off. And now my new psych tested me for adhd( which I suffered when I was younger and also took Ritalin for almost a year and concerta for like almost 5 years) and she prescribed me concerta and told me to lower the doses as I wrote.. so maybe it wasn’t depression/ anxiety and just the adhd ? Sorry for long post guys. Please just need some opinions",1,0,0,0

"Medication is currently causing a lot of side effects for me so I cant take it. I WFH and my job is currently maintaining something with no specific deadlines. I used to live with other people and so resources such as bathroom and kitchen was scarce and that motivated me to do things like brush my teeth and clean dishes asap. I now live alone.This now means that outside of academia and intense work (Ive chosen to take a step back at work to minimise stress), I have ZERO external motivators to do anything. Im not a morning person either. Despite waking early, it feels like I lack motivation till night time at which point I feel depressed the entire day is gone. Ive tried to drink coffee in the mornings only. Tried gentle sitcoms to try and wake up and be alert in mornings. But I just totally lack motivation. I can have not brushed my teeth an entire day and fed myself crap because I havent gone through the routine for my mornings. Everyday is a wasted day. I have no accountability to anyone, regarding cleaning my place, or exercising, or being healthy, or eating well. Work is the only accountability I have. So as ideal as this may sound I feel like Im spiralling and just never managing to achieve anything. Not even go for a walk or go to the gym. I dont really know what to try anymore. I dont know if anyone really gets what Im saying and has overcome it. What really strikes me is the contrast between my behaviour now and how productive and efficient I was for years of intense pressure. Ive done the, time your activity, focus for ten min at a time, all those sort of tips. The only motivator without external influences is amfexa and that comes with such bad migraines I become bedridden, negating any positive effects.

Mind you, I knew I wanted to study this back then, but I still didn’t apply).I need either a high-paced intense job (like ER), something social (like a teacher but I’m not quite sure, it’s stressful, really), lawyer seems fun but I know it’s a lot of paperwork and it’s probably boring in real life - anything like that. I also love something creative, but yeah not many options here. Considered journalism for a while. What do your work as, do you love it and why is it the perfect match?

Every major (and minor) public servant is supposed to be represented during the parade, and Im just a volunteer fireman with less than a year of experience, but I was proposed to go and march on our most important national holiday and represent us all: to march in front of the head of state wearing the fire departments helm and armour and go on national television.Now, Im really not a fan of this kind of pomp, I dont like our government or our politicians and Im not proud of my country, but I am proud of what I do as a volunteer fireman, I am proud to be in the fire brigade. And when Im asked to march with a hundred more firemen from all over our country, of which only a handful are volunteers, that means something to me.So I write a message to my mother, because even though she thinks I am completely out of place in the fire brigade, because Im too weak and Ive always surrendered easily, and she thinks I dont need therapy or meds, you just need the attention, you might as well take placebos! and every time we talk she just brings me down and I become completely unable to fight her, but I think that this thing that happened means something. This really means something, theyve always watched the parade on tv and I could be right there on tv this year, she will appreciate this, also because the training for the parade takes a month and theyll pay me, so she will surely appreciate this.Mom, Ive been proposed to represent the fire brigade at the parade in ****** on the * of ***!Ok.Then she asked me to send her some old receipt.",1,0,0,0

It’s hard to convince myself that I can do this when I see everyone around me sticking the landing on the first try.

"For me, the only way to remember to take my ADHD meds in the morning (when Im at my most distractible) is strict adherence to a routine. Unfortunately, if literally anything happens dislodge me from my routine (hey look! the cat is being cute!.....that was it today) it all goes to hell and I inevitably forget about my pills. Anyway, the knee-jerk solution is to just have an emergency morning dose of medication on ones person, but the problem here is when the routine gets thrown off, Im usually not just forgetting my pills, but forgetting that I forgot to take my pills. This puts me in the dilemma. Without having a way to absolutely 100% know if I did or did not take my morning medication, I could end up unmedicated and have my productivity go to zero if I didnt take my pills but err on the side of caution. However, if I do take the emergency dose, I risk a possible overdose if I did indeed take my morning dose but just forgot that I took it.I found a really simple and cheap solution that addresses this problem.The solution is in the form of a programmable button stuck to the bottom of a shot glass. The programmable button is made by <a href=""https://flic.io/"">Flic</a>, and I set it up to send my phone a text that simply says morning pills taken. Ive working it into my routine that first I load up the shot glass with my morning pills, and then immediately after taking them, I flip the shot glass over and push the button. This sends the morning pills taken text message to my phone. To go along with this, I set up a recurring reminder on my phone that pops the message morning pill check up on my phone everyday at 10AM to remind me to check for the text message and act accordingly.

"Is it a symptom of ADHD to underestimate the importance of small (seemingly redundant) steps? For example, adding an appointment to ones calendar, even though it takes max. a minute, or doing the 2 little dishes that are on the sink that would only take 1-2 minutes to clean, yet you procrastinate it? I ask this bc I wonder how much of our procrastination is actually bc of fear of big daunting tasks <strong>vs.</strong> how much results from underestimation (bc of the idea that if a task isnt challenging enough, its not worthy of being attended to immediately) of the easy-to-do but necessary small tasks (also bc accomplishing small tasks may not give as big a dopamine reward as big tasks, so we ignore them) <strong>vs.</strong> how much comes from irrational fear of the effort required by the task (inaccurate overestimation of its difficulty) perhaps rooted in a general insecurity around ones self-efficacy (<em>an individuals belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments</em>). And, as it goes, the small tasks only accumulate over time only and become daunting once weve ignored enough of them.I know that conventional wisdom would insist that the (ADHD) brain will act logically by usually/almost always doing quick small simple tasks coz why not?

"Long story short, I have an official diagnosis from several years ago, I see a brick &amp; mortar psychiatrist every 3 or 4 months, so this shouldnt be too much of an issue to navigate.

So, instead of paying $10 for generic, I pay $30? If thats the case, I dont give a shit, and would pay a slightly higher premium to not deal with this nonsense. I dont understand how any of this works since getting brand name was never an issue in the past.",1,0,0,0
"My procrastinating is ruining my mental health. I really like waiting until the last minute and the chaos I feel from completing a task at the last minute. BUT! I also hate it. I love the rush, but I hate this now. I hate knowing I could have done better. I hate barely skating by and getting something in by a deadline. My perfectionism won’t let me miss a deadline which is a blessing but it also tortures me for procrastinating. All the time I spend mentally berating myself and being paralyzed and not doing my work, I could be actually doing it. (Like right now, could be writing three essays but I’m on Reddit asking how to stop procrastinating.) But I also love it. I love waiting till the day of and pulling it all together in the end and being amazed with myself in the process. As I have gotten older, my hate for this habit has begun to outweigh the love. I know if I actually worked on things in a timely manner I would have less self loathing and my time spent having fun would actually be fun, and not an existential whirlpool of consistent self hatred and a desire to be better. I also know if I work on things and actually apply myself, I will feel proud of my work and not just proud of the fact that I “pulled it off” also I know that it would help me fight off and stave off burnout which I am extremely prone to as well. Anyone else procrastinate like this? Anyone have any advice on how to get more organized?",1,0,0,0
"Hey all you lovely and helpful people from this subreddit. I (M 32) was just diagnosed recently and it feels like living in a completely new reality. Everything is still new to me but this subreddit has already helped me a lot. And seeing that the community here is super helpful, Ive decided to take all my courage and post my question here.Other than many people here I have the luck and the privilege, that my friends and family are super supportive and helpful (as far as its possible for them). But its not so easy for them, since they cant imagine how it is to have ADHD. And I really struggle (or honestly completely fail) to describe it. In the end it always sounds so harmless and insignificant. Its hard for me to find the line: I dont want them to worry, but I want them to understand.So, if you have read this far; thank you, and do you have any tips how to describe ADHD in a meaningful snd not scary way?tl/dr; as the title says, how do I describe ADHD to my NT friends so that they dont worry about me but understand how my brain works.P.s.: sorry if thats been already asked a docent times, Ive scrolled through the history of this sub, but guess what, Ive got distracted, one thing led to another and I ended up online looking for where I can buy a donkey...Edit: thanks for all the useful input! I try to answer all of you as good as I can, but I dont have that much time, but, guess what, ADHD",1,0,0,0
Last year I was first diagnosed as an adult. Was taking 30MG of Adderall XR brand name. It worked great. Now come Jan 2023 my insurance switched to generic. The effects aren’t the same nor do I feel it works as well. I have always had this happen with generics. Taking the generic I will take 1.5 pills and it seems to work better but I’m short before the month is over. Is there a way for me to get 40MG XR? Do I need to see a specific provider?,1,0,0,0
"My 7yo has been on probably every ADHD medication known to man, including Azstarys which made his eyes cross and him act psychotic on half the dose he was prescribed which was the end of stimulants or so I thought. The others gave him bad ticks like hair pulling of teeth grinding or made him anxious or act worse which made both of us scared, strattera KINDA worked but stopped very quickly, Guanfacine didnt help at all really. Hes got ODD and ADHD, so you can imagine what behavior he exhibits... Anyways, his amazing new prescriber wanted to try Quelbree, I was nervous and wasnt sure about it at first. She gave us a child trial kit, since he is really sensitive to medication I gave him half the 100mg which he was suppose to take for about a week (100mg). No symptoms, didnt help but didnt figure it would just wanted to see how he would react, after 2 days put him on the full 100, after about 4 days of no adverse symptoms with that I put him on the 200mg thats in the kit as she said if he didnt react badly to the medication I could do that. Its no fix but its helped tramendously COMPARED TO OTHERS. I think one more raise in dosage might be what does him well... Im crossing my fingers that hes able to take it long term.. Hes still having problems learning in school but thats another issue for another time and is due to the school hes in which Im changing next school year. But, if your child has problems with other stims, I cannot brag on this medication enough, its worth a shot! Im just glad something is working for him, plus I think his age is helping him a little. ❤️🥺🤞",1,0,0,0

"I’m currently titrating onto Elvanse (I think it’s the same as Vyvanse in the US) and up to now it’s been really good, my focus has been better, I’ve been on top of my household stuff (I even cooked a full meals 3 days in a row right after uni!) and I’m less distracted. My symptoms are always worse around when I have my period, and it seems the same is true when on meds (although it felt like a normal unmedicated day rather than an unmedicated day on my period). I moved up to 40mg during my period and I’ve moved up to 50mg this week.Since going up to 50mg it feels like I can’t do anything. I’ve stopped feeling all the good effects and my ability to start tasks seems to have jumped out the window- yesterday I didn’t do anything until the panic of being late for work set in. I honestly feel like I’ve had 4 really bad days from before I was on meds. The problem is that I can’t tell if this is a me and my hormones thing, or if this is what happens when you go up to a dose that you don’t need? I would mention it to my prescriber but when I talked my period last week, he seemed to avoid the subject when he replied. I also don’t want him to take me down a dose and then realise it was just my hormones and have go up again.Has anyone else experienced this? Do the positive effects disappear if you take too high a dose?TL;DR: I’ve gone up a dose and can’t tell if the lack of the positive effects is because it’s too high a dose or my hormones.

"Ive been taking 30mg daily of Vynanse / Elvanse (as we call it here in the UK) for 2 weeks now. During the first 5 days or so it was transformative - I was so focused and felt incredibly motivated, getting tasks done, feeling positive, not so much overthinking etc.However after about 5 days I noticed that the effects werent as prominent which so far I have just ascribed to naturally developing a tolerance to the medication. I now dont notice a huge effect from taking it and find myself getting more easily distracted and procrastinating, not as motivated etc. - although the overthinking generally has remained much less severe and I still have a more positive outlook on lifeI was wondering if anyone else had experienced anything similar? Im definitely not going to self-prescribe a higher dose or anything like that but could that be whats needed? Or is this a very normal part of getting used to the medication? Equally though, Ive had a lot going on in life in the last couple weeks - nothing negative but maybe that occupation of the mind is whats causing itThanks in advance for your answers :)",1,0,0,0
"Ive always been going with the flow my whole life. I finished high school and got into college (Im canadian so its like a post secondary skilled trades school). I was able to just wing it on all the exams and required testing so it was never really a problem for me except my grades have always hovered around 60s with the extremely rare 70. Since Covid hit, I got laid off my job and decided to try out a university engineering program. I was fine for the first semester barely keeping myself out of academic probation at 60 but I just finished second semester and failed 1 course and everything else is in the low 50s. Finding out I failed the course I put the most effort into was extremely demoralizing and this is the hardest thing Ive ever committed myself into and absolutely not something I can just do what Ive been doing. The only reason why Im passing the other courses is because of how the evaluation is set up so projects and assignments are decently weighted. I have been borderline passing or even failing all my exams so far. I feel like I prepare decently before the exams with reading the textbook and doing practice but crap seems to hit the fan when the exam starts.  I lose crazy amounts of marks for stupid mistakes or just blanking out during the exam. Im always running out of time and dont finish.

Basically I think I believe that at the end of the day, you just have to pick a side :1)You either mask and be neurotypical, learn how to mask and act normal interact with normal social cues, get a 9to5 job and then you go home feeling drained and exhausted from the effort that you have to do all day to perform well and be liked, like it took me quite some time to realize that masking sucks your soul dry.2)Or you either dont mask and unleash the weirdness and be insufferable and make people feel uncomfortable, you get called all kind of names like weird awkward. But like when you get home u also feel exhausted and drained from all the  mean and intense interactions that you have to go through the whole day and you just ask yourself whats wrong and then u remember theres nothing wrong with u and youre just different but people will never know that and they will always assume the worst out of you, they wouldnt respect you and youre always going to be the outcast everywhere u go but also at the same time youre also like at least Im being myself and Im not doing any effort to fit in and I like myself like this but honestly I believe that you just cant find a way out, all of the solutions are draining and you have to be super lucky to meet a life partner that can understand you and not judge you. You have to be extremely lucky or maybe I would say privileged  to have a supporting family that REALLY gets it.What do you guys think? Do you think theres a way out?

Get one that has brush tops that are super easy to access at your local store, not ones you have to remember to buy online. Hell, get one with Bluetooth you can play music on for fun. You will realize how bad you were at brushing your teeth, that you didn’t do it nearly long enough. You’ll realize how clean your mouth feels <em>all day</em> (so little tartar build-up.)

"I’m having a really rough moment in school right now and I could use some suggestions or just support I guess. Hopefully this post isn’t breaking any of the rules, my scan wasn’t as thorough as it normally would be.I’ve been taking stimulants for ADHD since February and originally they helped a lot with minimal side effects. Vyvanse was great at first but I noticed that my brain would get super tired at the end of the XR day and then the side effects quickly outweighed the benefits as my dose went up. I’ve been on Adderall IR since, usually taking 15-20mg once a day. Unfortunately I also have mood episodes (schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type).  Usually I get hypomanic at the end of the semester. This semester either something changed about my physical health or I’m in some kind of weird depressive episode. I’m exhausted, I ache everywhere for no reason, I’m moving SO slowly, and my cognitive functioning is nowhere near where it normally is. The Adderall still quiets the distracting thoughts but it doesn’t help me with focus, motivation, or attention anymore and it doesn’t help out my energy levels at all. Does anyone have any advice?

Im scared I might have to re-do the year in order to give myself time to sort out medication, coping strategies, proper study strategies, etc. This is all my fault as well- the only reason I have been diagnosed so late is because all throughout my life ive always tried super hard to seem like a perfect student who knows exactly what theyre doing and doesnt need help.

"I’m not diagnosed with adhd, it’s something I’m 90% certain I have but have always put off/forgot to talk to a doctor because I have generally learnt how best to manage the way I am.  I also get worried about employers seeing it as a negative and it effecting my employability so I guess I’m a little worried to even speak to someone about it.I’d like to write down the things I do which make me feel this way but it would be time consuming and I’m sure you all get a million questions per day asking if their symptoms are consistent with it.  So I won’t bore you with the details.Anyway getting to my point, why is it that we can find the smallest or in my case the most complex topic and really really focus on it in an all consuming way until we wrap our heads around it and then just loose all interest in the topic until maybe months later?  For instance I’ve taught myself nuclear physics to a degree, particle physics, cosmology, DJ’ing, farming, Greek and the list goes on … it drives me crazy because I adore learning about the subjects and will spend money on all the gear and then it will become just another hobby I’ve dropped.Why we do this?",1,0,0,0

"Recently got a part-time job as a barista next to my law studies. I love the job!!! Love coffee, love the cute little café, love talking to the nice customers.However, my ADHD is a bigger issue than I thought itd be. When theres a rush of customers I find myself getting extremely overwhelmed - I mix orders up, make stupid little mistakes (like trying to froth hot water LOL), and turn into what probably from the outside looks like a total incompetent/slow airhead. This embarrasses me so much as I dont want my boss thinking Im bad at this job when I really really love it and enjoy it!!! I have prior experience with overhearing a convo between two former co-workers talking about how stupid I am because I got overwhelmed at one busy shift.Whats frustrating is I KNOW how to make the coffee its just when theres a rush that my mind gets so overwhelmed and shuts down and goes into slow-mode. I bet the customers think I suck and that really upsets me. Are there any other baristas out there with ADHD? Do you guys struggle too and what do you do to help yourself?",1,0,0,0
"Hi. I’m newly on Vyvanse and have been for over 3 weeks now, but am finding that while it increases my productivity WHILE I’m doing something, it is definitely not some miracle pill that will make me want to suddenly do things I have historically avoided or procrastinated. Specifically, cleaning and cooking are my downfalls. I’m great when I’m at work, and if I can get myself to clean and do stuff then I am more productive than before and focused on task, but I still procrastinate or avoid. I’d rather play video games and be on my phone.Does anyone have any strategies or tools/resources that have helped in changing bad habits that were built? I know this piece will take strategic effort from me but I’m just not sure how to approach this. Thanks!!",1,0,0,0
"As far back as I remember, I did not pay attention in school. I would daydream OFTEN. I have literal gaps in the memories of my education.I went to college in my early 20s and it took me four years to earn an Associate Degree. I didn’t have children at the time and worked full time. I managed to graduate with a 3.7 GPA and with Honors. Here I am, 30 years old. I finally received an ADHD diagnosis and have been prescribed Vyvanse.I’ve been struggling so long with wanting to go back to school but never knew what I wanted to do, had the motivation, organized or set up a plan of action.With the help of Vyvanse, I have finally controlled my finances, set goals, become less impulsive and have become more organized.This week, I found a State University that offers a program that I am interested in. I looked over the program and realized that my degree won’t transfer. I applied to my local Community College and was advised that I only need 8 more courses to earn a transfer degree that will be applicable towards the Bachelor Degree I want.I am over the moon. I want this so bad and I really feel that now that I understand why I have struggled so bad, I can overcome it and earn my degree.It’s different now, I do have a toddler at home and I do work opposing hours of my husband but for the first time, I truly feel like I can accomplish this.

"As I was learning about ADHD, rejection sensitivity was one of those lightbulb moments where suddenly I understood so many of my relationships and ongoing struggles Id been having. And Ive been much kinder to myself recently when I get a bit triggered. But a recent moment has just thrown me so much.Im in a period of my life where I dont want a relationship while I do a lot of healing, but I had a lovely, functional, no strings attached FWB relationship with a friend. We were communicating well about what we wanted and didnt want, and have only been intimate a couple of times. He mentioned the other day that he was considering a relationship with another person he had met, just to give me the heads up in case they started dating. I felt totally ok with that, albeit a bit sad to lose the spicy side of the relationship. ;) Then completely by accident, we ran into each other at an event. Hes with a the person he was talking about (I had never met her), and they are super cuddly and physical with each other. On a logic level, Im happy not to date this guy, hes a beautiful friend, I do not want a relationship right now, and we had been so clear about our intentions. But seeing them together unexpectedly, the feeling of being rejected hit me like a brick. I went home and couldnt stop sobbing, and my chest still feels like my heart has been ripped out a day later. I just want to block him and not deal with how horrible I feel, even though logically everything is completely ok.I just want to share my frustration with this, these feelings are so intense, and the logic of the situation doesnt seem to matter at all. Once my body has decided Im being rejected, BOOM it all comes up again. :(Would love some support on this, or even just to share how horrible this feeling is.

"I (26f) really enjoy cooking and I consider myself to be fairly good at it. I like cooking for my boyfriend (25m), as well as with him (although I have to give him very specific instructions, one at a time, while doing most of the work). However, every once in a while it would be nice if he could cook something tasty for me without help. Or even if he could just cook for himself when I’m not around. He understands cooking basics - how to chop, boil, sauté, etc - and knows how to make simple things. The problem is, he has adhd and is unbelievably disorganized and slow in the kitchen.The other morning he wanted to make us some simple avo toast - which consisted of toasting bread, mashing and spreading avocado, slicing some tomatoes, and cooking two eggs (one for each of us). This would have taken me ten mins max, but since he wanted to do it alone, I watched two whole episodes of Schitt’s Creek while he worked - so like 45 mins. He toasted the bread first and then took too long to do everything else (because he did it one thing at a time), so the toast was cold by the time he gave it to me. And he didn’t cook our eggs at the same time either so his took another several mins to finish, at which point I was done eating when he finally sat down.I try to be patient with him and not say anything that could make him feel discouraged, but I do get frustrated. I know he is trying his best, but I want to teach him to be a bit more intuitive and better with his time in the kitchen. I don’t have adhd though so it’s hard to put myself in his shoes and communicate certain cooking concepts (which make perfect sense to me) to him in a way that would resonate. I would really appreciate your tips on how to effectively work with him to multi-task and manage his time while cooking.Sorry this was long.Tl;dr How do I teach someone with ADHD to cook?

"I feel like this has been a lifelong struggle—I’ve never really been all that rebellious/defiant, but I naturally struggle to memorize things, keep up with others around me, etc. Today at work (I’ve been there for a year and a half), I got a talking to from a higher-up in the company. He said that someone else on my team informed him that I just don’t seem to pull my own weight, and I also apparently have gaps in my knowledge that I “should already know at this point”. It just sucks because I’ve never felt like I slack off on purpose, or intentionally cut corners, I’m always quick to call myself out when I make mistakes and immediately apologize whenever necessary, etc. Basically I feel like I have the right attitude but I can just feel others’ annoyance with me when I ask for help, and now that’s basically been confirmed in a way.",1,0,0,0
"Im writing this as I enjoy some ice cream and Star Trek at the end of the day...On Tuesday, after many, many years of struggling with ADHD symptoms (along with anxiety and depression), at almost 40.5 years old, I was finally officially diagnosed with ADHD and started on medication for it. My provider started me on 10 mg Adderall XR for 8 days with a follow-up next week (along with the Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Abilify that I already take). After way too many phone calls (ugh), I finally not only found a pharmacy that actually had some in stock but also got my providers practice to send the prescription to them yesterday. Even then, they still only had 7 pills in stock, but that was good enough for me since its just an initial trial anyway to see how well it works for me. I didnt get a chance to go to the pharmacy last night before they closed, so I picked them up first thing this morning before work. Took one as soon as I got home around 9:15 am.All I can say is...wow. I felt more focused, more productive, and less distractible today than I have in a long, long time. I dont feel as mentally exhausted as I usually do at the end of the day. I noticed myself being more upbeat and cheery, even, as I was reading bedtime stories to my almost-3-y/o. I even was able to get myself to start a load of dishes started at 10 pm - usually by that point in the evening I am more than done with things and am basically just in the middle of a 3-hour doom-scrolling session on my phone. But I just ... got up from my desk, went downstairs, and got the dishwasher unloaded, re-loaded, and started. Its almost like I didnt know such a thing was even possible. It felt amazing.It sucks that it took me this long to finally get officially diagnosed, and that it was such a hassle to get the meds, and that the ADHD itself is an impediment to getting treatment in the first place, but man am I glad to have gotten it done (and a little proud of myself, too, not gonna lie).",1,0,0,0
"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD &amp; Im trying to match it up with my symptoms &amp; things that annoy me but Ive been doing for years. Habits are the worst. Ive had to make it a forced habit to brush my teeth every day, &amp; I have. I even floss bc of the yuck that gets in there. I know this is a typical ADHD thing &amp; Ive worked on changing it.Im almost always late, sometimes by a lot. Im still working on it, so when Im on time I really celebrate!!But, one thing I havent been able to change. Im embarrassed to even admit this, but my sleep habits are terrible. I stay up all night and sleep all day. Sometimes 12 hours, although I think that has to do more with my fibromyalgia than depression or ADHD. If Ive had a big day, for example, gone food shopping, gotten HEAVY water jugs, made store returns etc. then Im wiped out the next day. But I digress.I cant say I slept last night, or Im having breakfast (at dinner time), or any of the normal things. Thats the easy part, though. Its hard to get to the stores or make calls or appointments.  I realize the people who work the overnight or grave yard shift have the same issues. But, I cant say I do this for a job bc I havent worked in 18 years since Fibro took me out. I used to work as in an office, but when I was in my 20s I worked in a bar. So yes, way back when I worked nights. Im 64 now &amp; desperately want to change.Ive tried taking my meds earlier &amp; not looking at blue light at night and black out curtains. Ive tried some exercises when I can, &amp; even hypnosis! (I cant be hypnotized apparently). Is this an ADHD thing?Anyway if anyone has this issue Id appreciate some support &amp; suggestions that worked.  Sorry its so long. ADHD oversharing!TL;DR I stay up all night &amp; sleep all day. Im embarrassed &amp; hate this &amp; want to change, but I need help/support. Is this an ADHD thing?",1,0,0,0
"I am ADHD - PI, and i went to get diagnosed because of two things:<ul><li>I have poor impulse control that have led me into jumping into stuff that were harmful for myself. Like going all or nothing on a lot of “new shiny things” that then collapse and leave me shattered.</li><li>I struggle with emotions, so i completely lose it and are unable to calm down a lot. Also i change mood and goals on a whim, which makes therapy really hard</li></ul>I am still a mess who cant focus, study normally or work normally. But i have made systems that work, and i have all my life generally accepted that “normal life” doesnt work for me, so i dont try to live normally. I also have ton of alarms that keeps me from forgetting things. So i generally dont feel daily that i am impaired because if all these systems i have made. My doctor and psycholigst wants me to take medication. But when i read about adhd it seems like we are pretty made for a different society or different type of life than neurotypical people. Why should i not just structure my life around what an adhd person is made for?I cant help but feel like medication is like giving us an oxygen tank for being able to breath and live underwater like neurotypicals, while we are made for walking on land instead. If land animals were trying to be sea animals, they would look disabled all the time This might be me having a hard time accepting the diagnosis, and i fully understand if some of you are really struggling and i am sounding like an idiot.Can someone help me understand and enligthen me? Will medication help with stuff like impulse control, and emotional problems? And even if i am able to work normal 9-5 and understand instructions, wouldnt i feel like “this is not me”?",1,0,0,0
"So many times during the day, I have random trivial thoughts that I’d like to share with my partner, but I don’t want to bother him during the work day. He religiously checks every text he gets, so I don’t want to do that because I know he would get annoyed if I sent multiple unimportant things during the day (he keeps his sound on in case of his family emergencies). I have tried writing things down in a note, but then I forgot to looks at it when he gets home. I’m basically looking for an app where I can write things down, and it won’t notify him/ ping him while he’s working, but he can check in periodically throughout the day and respond as he wants/has time. He has an android, and I have an iPhone. Hopefully this makes sense.",1,0,0,0
"Hey everyone,I got “provisionally” diagnosed and my psychiatrist prescribed me 5mg of Ritalin when need, but not more than 15mg a day combined. When I took my very first 5mg I didn’t really feel anything so 40-60mins later I took another 5mg but that didn’t make any difference really. Kinda confused because before taking the med I was super happy that I finally found what can help me and change smthn in my life, I was smiling the whole time while coming home to try it for the first, but looks like tge dose is very low or Ritalin doesn’t really work on me.",1,0,0,0
"Hi, Im 26 and I think I might have ADHD.I have had social anxiety since I was a teenager, though anxiety meds never helped me. When I read about rejection sensitive dysphoria it ressonated a lot with me.I also have a lot of things that point to innatentive ADHD: -difficulty listening to what people are saying because I am thinking about something unrelated, or I just forget to proccess words somehow-house is always a mess unless someone is coming over, which is not frequent-waiting mode-writing an e-mail takes forever-make easily avoidable mistakes, sometimes mistakes that have very real consequences, then I cant stop thinking about it for weeks-I go to the supermarket to buy a thing and come back with everything but the thingWell this is to name a few things.Do people who got diagnosed with ADHD as adults relate?Do you think it is worth it to try to get a diagnosis at this point? I feel like psychiatrists wont take me seriously.I have tried before, psychiatrist said I dont have it, but I honestly did not agree with her analysis. She listed education level, among other things, as a reason I might not have ADHD.",1,0,0,0
"I needed to catch two trains to get from home to my destination. I left on time and strolled to the station feeling smug. Then ran home in a fluster, grabbed the wallet I’d left in another bag, and ran back to the station just in time to throw myself sweatily between the closing doors of the train. I transferred to the second train and was seven stations down the line before I realised I’d wandered onto the wrong one. I backtracked on a third train and was twenty minutes late for my meeting. I bought myself a coffee and some lunch to console myself, and caught the first train of my homeward trip, which is when I realised I’d accidentally left the coffee on the counter at the cafe. Oh well. I ate the lunch at the connecting station waiting for the second train home while reading reddit. The train arrived, I hopped in, settled down… and realised I’d thrown my reading glasses in the bin with my lunch wrappers. So, I’ve just caught the fifth train of my four-train commute to go back and ask the nice railway-worker-station-guy to open the bin for me so I can get my glasses out. Now waiting for a sixth train so I can go home. Or shall I just give up and throw myself in the bin? (I wish I was making this up. And this is on medication!)Edited to add: turns out I didn’t notice the sixth train was an express which doesn’t stop at my station - so now my four train commute is six trains and a bus!!!",1,0,0,0
"I just watched this little documentary that mentioned Adderall and it was very stigmatizing. It brought me back to a memory of a conversation I found myself in about a month ago with a person who abused Adderall, so now believes no one should have access to it. The same person thought only Ritalin should be available because “It works just fine.” I tried to educate the person on the fact that it’s well-known that Ritalin flat-out doesn’t work for many people with ADHD. My personal experience with Ritalin was that it didn’t work and it gave me terrible SI. But trying to educate the person didn’t work because they just saw me as the a-hole arguing against the validity of their substance use disorder (although that wasn’t my intention at all). Ugh… it was so irritating. I’m just curious if there are any documentaries that are educational and non-stigmatizing out there about ADHD and treatment for it. I’d enjoy watching them myself, but I’d also love to be able to recommend them if I ever interact with someone that says something ignorant to me again. Then if they’re actually interested, hopefully they’ll watch it and learn something. And bonus! It saves me from having a disheartening discussion.",1,0,0,0
"My skin is terribly damaged and I cant stay consistent enough with skincare to fix it, Im probably not going to college, and I have no friends. All I can do is jerk off and it really just makes me feel worse about myself. Our adhd brains lack dopamine thus its vital for us to aquire adequate amounts of dopamine to keep ourselves functional. I cant get that dopamine. Theres no part of my life I can look to and find happiness. My adhd brain requires dopamine, dopamine i cannot get. This leads me to not feeling motivated to do anything and I thus continue to fuck myself. Im fucking trapped. Ive been trapped for years. I cant possibly continue my life like this. As for meds, Ive been on Strattera 25mg for a little over a week and a half. No side effects and I think it may have worked the first couple days, but the effect seems to have gone away after those couple days.

"Hi there, posting for im not really sure what…maybe words of affirmation idk.

It’s just ungodly piles and I can’t stop crying with shame, disappointment, embarrassment and guilt. I have scheduled for 1800 got junk to come, but just getting everything in an area to even be taken away is so hard, and it’s so shameful that good things will go to the garbage.
