"Been struggling with heart palpitations (feeling of a skipped beat) for almost 2 years on and off.At one point I suffered with this for a full 24 hrs, a feeling of a skipped beat nearly every 2-3 minutes.

"I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I started seeing a psychiatrist eleven or twelve years ago. In that time Ive lost track of how many meds weve tried for both anxiety and depression. None of them have helped even mildly. Ive also tried therapy with two different therapists. Also, no help. I am currently unmedicated and have been so for over a year, but still see her occasionally just to check in. At this point it feels like Im just treading water and Im thinking about not going back.

Its unusual for me to be so anxious but blood work and such came back normal. Ive managed to calm myself down and havent had any panic attacks the past few days. However, I am suffering from weird side effects I think ??? I feel like its some type of possible brain fog ? but I feel mentally impaired. Thinking is rough, I misspell things, I comprehend things slowly, my reflexes are bad. I cant concentrate. I have random weird sensations all over my head which make me worry theres something wrong with it. In a way, it feels scary as if Ive just developed a sudden neurological disorder with how it feels.

"He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, Id look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; Id just watch the videos. When he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever Id watch his videos, my TikTok views would rise. This continued for the better part of a year.However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn‚Äôt follow him back). I know it doesnt sound like a big deal, but Im 95% sure he was watching my TikToks. When our friends told people he liked me, it was clear he didnt want me to find out. But when they broke up and started entertaining me again, he started following her on TikTok. It makes me feel like he wanted to get back with her, and that if she agreed, he wouldve hung me out to dry again. I dont have any solid evidence for this, but it scares me that he wouldve done that. Keep in mind, they were already Instagram friends.Edit: several months later, he made a playlist about me. Im 95% sure its about me because it has 22 songs and was made 22 days before my 22nd birthday. These songs are all in English and the first song is I love you and the last song is called Bay Area (Im from San Francisco)",0,0,1,0
I dont get it. How am i supossed to build a stable life when every couple of weeks a new wave of anxiety hits me and knocks me out for an uncertain amount of time. Coule be days. Could be weeks. Could be months. Where im completely unable to follow a normal daily routine. Even that small walk that youre supossed to do takes more effort than it should.How am i supossed to hold a stable job like that? How am i supossed to make a living?

"Anyone else get near constant anxiety or mini panic attacks worrying that youre doing something wrong, that youve done something wrong, or that youre forgetting or neglecting to do something that youre supposed to be doing?After social interactions, I get overwhelmed with emotions and stress worrying that I did something wrong, offended someone, made myself look like a fool, or said the wrong thing. I love socializing, but this anxiety after the fact just gets overwhelming.Similarly, when Im trying to relax and enjoy myself, such as with videogames, I feel guilty, ashamed, and kind of terrified that I should be doing something more productive, even when its late in the evening and I need to decompress for an hour. It gets in the way of me enjoying my relaxation time, and then I feel the need to stay up late afterwards trying to calm my brain down enough to sleep.Im sure Im not the only person with these issues, but what do you guys do about it? Have any of you found methods to work on this problem and reduce anxious reactions to these kinds of insecurities? Ive tried looking at the situation objectively, telling myself that everything is ok, and a few other things, but I just cant seem to find an approach that works.",0,0,1,0

My boyfriend and I lived with each other for a year and then both ended up moving back home as rent was to expensive. Ever since then I‚Äôve found myself extremely anxious (possibly borderline obsessive?) with my boyfriend and our relationship. I go into full blown panic attacks when I don‚Äôt hear from him for a couple hours and am constantly living in fear he will leave me. My boyfriend is not a great texter and is extremely independent and doesn‚Äôt feel a need to text or call throughout the day. Typically we call once before bed, for him this one call is enough (he probably would be ok with even less). Despite his own ideals he often goes out of his way to meet my needs. However nothing he does ever seems to fully meet my needs. I am constantly anxious no matter what he says or does and when I don‚Äôt hear from him (like tonight he didn‚Äôt say night or call before bed) I spiral into a dark place. I‚Äôm not sure how to get my independence back. I see a therapist weekly and am constantly trying to be better for him and myself. I love him and want to be with him (so anyone who wants to recommend breaking up please do not comment as this will only make me more anxious). Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you claim your independence back and stop living in anxiety?",0,0,1,0

"Today it‚Äôs dog hair. I have a golden retriever mix, or should I say my kids do, I want nothing to do with it. I said no dogs, so we got a dog. That was a year ago. Anyway, it‚Äôs shedding. It‚Äôs ruining my yard, its bringing/attracting carpet beetles into my home, it‚Äôs chewing things‚Ä¶ The hair is causing me to avoid sitting on certain furniture because I don‚Äôt want to have hair on me. The breeder (who still owns the dog legally, we are guardians) assured me when we got the dog that it was low shed. That was a lie. Nothing sheds like this dog. I want to give the dog back (which is totally allowed in the contract) but my kids are attached to the dog now so that‚Äôs off the table. My kids have tried to placate me by brushing the dog and vacuuming and covering the furniture but now I‚Äôm just concerned that now the couch and the sheet are covered in dog hair.

I am in my last year of high school + I must study in an academy, since here in my country (Chile), I have to take a general test to enter a university. I have given essays on that test, only in mathematics I have done well but, I am afraid that in the same test I will get so nervous, besides that many are having high expectations of me and that puts pressure on me.  Im not having a good time, mentally and emotionally Im not stable, both due to past experiences and my own self-esteem, but I try to improve on it every day as much as I can. I have many thoughts that I really couldnt say why they happen, many times I have visited a psychologist or seen videos or found out about it, but still I dont understand them. Currently I am not going to a psychologist for money issues + I do not have much confidence with them, I had 4 psychologists in the past and... Things did not go very well. In addition to that, I dont really know what I want for my future, Im thinking about something related to Engineering/Physics but I still havent decided and that gives me a lot of doubts about whether Ill earn money, whether Ill be someone in life, if I will be able to achieve my goals, if I will be able to be happy, if in truth what I will study is what I am passionate about. Lately Ive been trying to give myself tasks every day to combat everything that makes me feel bad, since many times I dont feel motivated to do things or waste time, which I hate, but I know its common. A few times, I lost the motive to do something, I just lay/sit, thinking about life, or what Ive done, sometimes I cry, sometimes I just hug my pillow.

"Hi all. Im not very well educated when it comes to mental illnesses and/or anxiety in particular, but I appreciate that there can be many symptoms of such and Im trying to understand whether the way Im feeling is linked to anxiety.I get these worried feelings about things that have happened, with unknown consequences. It can be something Im potentially guilty of, or something I am completely not responsible for, or something out of my control. The issue is not knowing the outcome.Generally I am less scared of the outcome than not knowing at all. An example could be simply passing a speed camera in my car, and having a sinking feeling that maybe I was going too fast, even though I know I probably wasnt. But this worried feeling remains until enough time has elapsed that no letter has come in the post, and I know I wasnt speeding.Another example could be going out for drinks with friends or family. I wake up feeling guilty and unsure if I could have said something to upset someone. And I worry about it until Ive had a chance to eventually catch up with everyone after the night out and obviously everyone is totally cool which gives me no reason to think i could have said or done anything bad!Id imagine the easiest solution to resolving these feelings would be to find ways to reduce the amount of time not knowing the outcome, but this isnt really always possible or feasible.Does anyone else have similar experiences?",0,0,1,0

At its worst it feels like my throat is closing, but I dont have any shortness of breath or wheezing. I can breathe just fine during these episodes and my oxygen levels are normal per my pulse oximeter. Furthermore, I find that this feeling quickly goes away if Im actively engaged in something and not hyperfocusing on it.My rational side should just accept this as the globus feeling and that my throat is not actually closing, but my anxious hypochondriac side takes over and I keep getting convinced that Im on the verge of anaphylaxis, even though I have no known significant allergies. I made the mistake of going down the Google rabbit hole and finding out that anaphylaxis and allergies can pop out of nowhere, even if you werent allergic before, so now Im terrified of eating things like shrimp and peanuts, even though Im not allergic to these foods.Anyone else? Or just some supporting words? Im living everyday fearing that Ill go into anaphylaxis shock at any moment, especially when my throat gets that lump/tight feeling.

"TW: mention of SA I am so sorry if this question is insensitive or what I‚Äôm asking is just plain stupid. I don‚Äôt even know if psychosis is the correct word.

When i was a kind i was alwais being called too sensitive. Ever since i can remember all i felt was pure terror. Even my first memory is of a panic attack. So i decided i am gonna become one of the strong brave people that can go through anything. And i felt like made it.

I was even known as the reckless person not scared of anything. Now for the first time in a while i actually got to a moment where things are relatively peacefull. And my anxiety came back and is kicking my ass big time. I have major depresion and i managed to be functional. I have bpd and i got through all of my episodes no matter how bad they were. But the anxiety? It doesnt even let me leave my bed somedays. I used to do shit like coke or lsd over weekends and now i can not even drink coffee becouse i fear it will give me a panic atack.

"Hello guys, Before I‚Äôll explain my situation, I want to make clear that I don‚Äôt look for medical advice that replaces a professional one. Just here to find other people that have/had similar symptoms. So everything started a few days back. I was driving with my mother to the supermarket when I turned my head real quick and back to the normal position which made me dizzy. My mother was getting gas for the car while I sat inside. I felt off. Once we arrived at the supermarket I got out of the car and got hit by a full-blown episode of derealisation, dizziness, and faint-like symptoms. I began to panic and realized I am mid of a panic attack. I overcame my fear and went into the supermarket where it was horrible. Dizzy, sweating, heavy breathing, problems walking straight, and claustrophobic. Eventually, it all settled down.Problem is. Today I went outside and it hit me again!! Even harder than in the supermarket. Completely dizzy. The Ground feels like moving. Walking in clouds. Vision is like delayed and mad panic. When I try to ground myself the symptoms disappear but are instantly back once I lose focus.I am in a rage right now. I google symptoms for 1 day and fear falling back again. I beat this shit once but I never had this much dizziness. Does anybody here experience something likewise and could share some tips with me ? If this won‚Äôt go away in a couple of days I will go to a doctor and get completely checked. But once again. When I am at home the symptoms are gone.

"Hi- looking for some input as to the situation I am in. My psych doctor, who prescribes my medication for anxiety/depression, can be very irritable/mean when I contact him about a pharmacy question. Most recently my pharmacy ran into a problem regarding my insurance, I had to reach out to him to fill out paperwork and he snapped. Its more so his frustration with the pharmacy/insurance and not with me personally (I think), but it makes me very uncomfortable. I dont know how to respond and as someone with anxiety it makes me over all uneasy to ask him anything! This is not the first time he has done this. He sometimes responds in very short emails, not really answering the question/ saying the pharmacist should know what to do. It puts me in a very odd position to then have to reach back out to the pharmacist myself and they usually just tell me the same thing. I have avoided contacting him in the past because of this. Any advice on how to respond? Is this wrong or is it par for the course dealing with doctors/pharmacists? TIA",0,0,1,0

"Since the start of April I have been experiencing bad tooth problems, tooth ache and pain around my left side of my jaw/face. At the start of April, I didnt do much about it seemingly, since the pain wasnt extreme and was relieved with painkillers. It was until the end of the month I started to experience the worst toothache pain ever. Im unsure where this pain radiates from, its either my wisdom tooth/molar at the back or the cracked tooth. Or both. Anyway! Im extremely worried its escalated into something severe and Im going to die from an infected tooth. I have left it too late, its my own fault, and I wish I reacted sooner. Especially since Im not registered to any dentist. Im also going on holiday for 2 weeks and dont want to deal with the implications abroad. At first, I was thinking a root canal would be best, but at this rate I just want it removed &amp; Im worried. The left side of my jaw/face is so SORE. Its like a dull ache &amp; a throbbing pain. Im anxious its terribly infected and reached to my brain. And my head is starting to hurt. Last night, it took me 4 hours to go to sleep due to the toothache being so painful. I tried the salt water rinse which helped for a bit, before round 2 of the pain started again. I was contemplating of taking myself to A&amp;E/ER in the middle of the night bc I didnt know what todo.

Its been 4 months of just suffering. Ive had some good weeks of normal but I really feel like not existing now. Is it actually my anxiety or do I really have something wrong with my gut.

"After overcoming and being treated for an anxiety disorder, I believe the root of disordered anxiety is a fear of being imperfect or a fear of discomfort.Its that fear of being imperfect and uncomfortable that drives you towards all the short-term behaviours like avoidance, rituals, etc.But the more you seek temporary relief, the more you feed into the faulty belief at the root of the issue, which is the belief that  I cant be imperfect and I cant survive this discomfort.Thats why exposure therapy is so effective because it challenges those core beliefs by teaching you that even if DEEPLY uncomfortable, you can survive anxiety/panic and that its ok to be imperfect.Over time, you become more comfortable with being uncomfortable.So instead of frantically responding to anxiety/panic symptoms with MORE anxiety/panic + trying to get rid of it (thus sending you into further spirals), youll start to respond with empathy and compassion for yourself. For example, Im feeling my heart beating hard and dizzy, but thats ok, Im not going to try and get rid of it, im just going to calmly let it pass.",0,0,1,0

"Hi guys. I was thinking about this coping/grounding technique i do, and i thought it could be super helpful to someone. I have PTSD tied in with anxiety, and one of the main things that sets my anxiety ticker off is being in a similar situation to a time I previously felt anxious. for example, months and months ago i was walking out of my apartment door and through the hallway to the vestibule when i started to feel a panic attack come on. it was dark and cold outside, which allowed me to let my dog pee and take a breath, but then i had to run back inside to let my panic fizzle out within the comfort of my own home. ever since that day, every single time i go to let my dog out at night, i think of that time. my brain hyper-remembers the situation, the struggle to get my key in the door, the empty hallway, the dizziness‚Ä¶ etc. i think that because i had a panic attack in that scenario before, it could happen again. UNTIL. one day, i realized that if i make something different about that routine, then it isn‚Äôt similar to the day i had the panic attack, meaning i won‚Äôt have another. so now every time i leave to let my dog out at night, i do something different. i use a different leash, i walk on the opposite side of the pole in the lobby, i check my mail, i even just look somewhere new. maybe i stop to look at a package sitting in the lobby and make sure it‚Äôs not mine. but as long as i do one single different thing, then my brain says ‚Äúoh, okay. no worries. this situation is different, im safe here.‚Äù",0,0,1,0

"So I have to fly with my family in a week, a 6 hour flight unfortunately. I have some claustrophobia I think, idk because my insurance stopped covering my therapist. I am not afraid of the flight or flying. I‚Äôm afraid of being trapped on the plane, like I can‚Äôt escape. It‚Äôs the same everywhere I go, like at the vet I felt trapped in the exam room with my dog. Basically I think it comes from when I panic, I tend towards flight and ‚ÄúI HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE‚Äù and I hate panicking in public. I have pretty bad social anxiety as it is, so the idea of drawing attention to myself is crippling anxiety. What if I panic and I can‚Äôt escape and everyone sees? Logically I know it doesn‚Äôt matter but the plane makes me feel trapped. Im on meds and have done years of therapy, I‚Äôve never had much luck with meds and I‚Äôve tried like 8. Even benzos don‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt have anything to take for the flight that would stave off a panic attack. So im anxious about panicking because I will feel trapped.

"I have lived in the same house since I was 8 years old. I dont remember this being an issue until like 5-10 years ago. The house is on a street that gets lots of drunks coming home at night and teens passing through. Our cars got mildly vandalized a few times in the past. But lately my fear of another vandalism is making my heart race fast and making it impossible to fall asleep. Every louder yell/scream from the street wakes me up. People talking outside our house at night gives me terrible anxiety. Sometimes it feels so bad I have to cover my ears and wait for them to leave.I have tried to convince my mom to park elsewhere but she refuses because she wants to see her car from the house. But what is the point since it only happens at night when we are all in our bed, it would take forever to get dressed anyway.I remember one day a few years ago I was sleeping with my window open because it was unbearably hot and I hear someone outside say you should kick the cars mirror and laughter. They didnt do it but those words were ringing in my head for weeks. I had trouble falling asleep for a long time after that.And then there are the teens. It has not been a problem as of late but a year or two ago for some reason teens found it hilarious to set off loud fireworks on our street every hour or so from 5pm to 1am. Usually lasted a few weeks and it repeated around Christmas and New Year.The worst thing is that these things I describe are extremely rare. But I get horrible anxiety whenever I hear people outside at night, especially when they are laughing or yelling at each other. I have to sleep with my windows closed because I have a very light sleep and I had trouble falling asleep even when I heard someone who was walking but not continuously.This will be one of the things I mention to my therapist who I see for the first time next month, but there are already so many topics that plaugue my life I dont think they will be able to guide me through this anytime soon.",0,0,1,0

"The last few days, I‚Äôve been getting, what I assume is anxiety, as well as insomnia, when I try and fall asleep, and tonight it started even just by me thinking about getting ready for bed. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety from a very young age, but this is my first time experiencing something like this. My chest gets tight and it feels like my heart is in the back of my throat, similar to what I feel at the start of a panic attack, but instead of starting to hyperventilate, it almost feels like I start forgetting to breathe and I have to think really hard about keeping a consistent breathing rhythm. However, as far as I can tell, my heart rate seems fairly normal when this happens, and I‚Äôm not having any anxious thoughts before it happens.I am concerned it might be health related, but I‚Äôm fine the rest of the day, so I‚Äôm not sure. I have noticed a bit of congestion in my throat and chest, so I feel like it could just be the congestion causing a bit of difficulty breathing, which then causes the anxiety that just exacerbates it. I have also started having other insomnia/sleep related issues that started at the same time as this though, such as difficulty falling and staying asleep and constant nightmares. If anyone can relate or have any suggestions, I would be extremely grateful as I‚Äôm desperate for sleep at this point. So far sitting up and really stretching my diaphragm and doing deep breathing has been somewhat helpful in the moment, but the breathing issues come back right after, and last night I was so desperate, I took a sleep aid and it did eventually help me fall asleep despite still being anxious and struggling to breathe.

I tried something different last night and it seemed to help calm me down. I was going to sleep and I started feeling the familiar adrenaline rush in my chest. That‚Äôs the first sign of more anxiety to come. I figured why not just sit with the anxiety and stop trying to justify it. Somehow I felt more relief accepting the fact that I was having the feeling instead of trying to fight it with thoughts and rationalizing it. Has anyone experienced this? Would journaling help process these feelings even more? Would love some more insight into how I can take this mentality to the next level because I think that I‚Äôm on to something that can help me. Will having this mindset help my brain distinguish what‚Äôs worth worrying about and what‚Äôs not? I mean I currently worry about things that would make even the biggest worrier shake their head in confusion. I‚Äôm always in kind of like a state of low to mid level anxiety and I‚Äôm always trying think the even the smallest worries away because I‚Äôm so focused on the the physical sensations from the anxiety and start trying to justify them. So I guess my question is can anyone relate or have any insight? Are there any tricks or tips to become more outwardly focused instead of always being so inward?,0,0,1,0

"I‚Äôve had anxiety for as long as I remember, however the nausea only came about 4 years ago. It is now most present on situations out of my comfort zone, when trying to date or hang out with new people. I have been trying to date for months but every time I either throw up or am about to throw up. The first person I went to meet, just before I walked in the restaurant I felt the back of my throat preparing to be sick so ran to the nearest toilet. Second time, with a different person, the exact same thing happened, although I saw the person, waved, then walked away as I was going to be sick. I have tried multiple medications such as prochlorperazine and cyclizine but they never work. I‚Äôm on anti-depressants and have been in regular therapy for more than a year. No matter how much I do, the sickness and nausea always happens as soon as I feel intense anxiety. Has or does anyone have the same experience? On a second attempt at a date with one of the people, I managed to stick through a whole 4 hours and we even kissed, however the whole 4 hours I felt intensely sick, I quietly retched multiple times and was overall extremely uncomfortable, even though I really liked the person. The 3rd attempt of dating this person ended after an hour of being with them and feeling sick the whole time so I decided I couldn‚Äôt push through any longer. This is all definitely anxiety induced and I do not have a hidden medical condition. I have had many tests and the sickness/nausea instantly goes away once I remove myself from the situation. I could be about to throw up and decided to leave the date and then 20 seconds later whilst walking away feel perfectly fine. I do not have a fear of sick or being sick, I just can‚Äôt bare the feeling of nausea and it is impossible for me to function with it.

His hypothesis is that I was given placebos hence why they never worked and only increased my anxiety. He also said this because he apparently was seriously cautioned about that and the psychiatrosh that prescribed it to him gave him a lecture on how serious of a drug it was, whereas I on the other hand was never given a lecture, I was suggested to try meds and so my therapist booked an appt with their psychiatrist and he prescribed me the SSRI and benzos to take until 2 weeks when apparently the SSRI should have been working.

Recently, at this activity and adult involved told them theyd like them to do their hair differently. They then started hyperventilating and when I looked over next they had passed out.

I get that it can be really hard to stop it and that Im not in their mind so I know how hard they are trying. But from an outside perspective, it seems like when they feel one coming on they just leave and deal with it.

Despite being able to make friends easily and being quite sociable, periods of stress always seem to creep up on me. However, over the past year, Ive reached a point where I can no longer enjoy life and have started to hate myself.My childhood was quite difficult and caused me to experience extremely high and recurring levels of stress every day. I have been experiencing depersonalization for over 18 years now and have no memories of my childhood. I often feel like Im living everything through a screen (a difficult sensation to explain).Over the past year, I have been going out more often to parties and social events, but every time I come home from a night out, I fall into a deep depression where I regret everything I said or did. This pattern repeats itself after every party or social event. I forget about it for a while, but then a week later, I find myself in the same state again. This has been going on for a year now, and I feel like Im stuck in a cycle that I cant break..I feel like Im no longer happy, I think about 200 things at once, and I regret what I say to people.On top of all this, I have been in a relationship for the past year. Before this, I was single for several years, during which time I didnt feel as much stress and was able to care less about other peoples lives. However, since entering this relationship, everything has started to come back, and my partner was quite emotionally unstable and unable to communicate, which completely broke my brain.

"Hi everyone. My name is Tim and I am a PhD student at the University of Chester in the UK.I am still looking to recruit participants for my final PhD study. You will be asked to complete some short questionnaires and take part in a brief online self-help programme which encourages mindful living and valued living. The idea is to help people live true to themselves; not just what society asks of each of us. You will be asked to practice some of the tasks throughout the next week. After the week, you will be asked to complete one final questionnaire. Part one should take you between 25 to 40 minutes to complete and part two should take you between 5 to 10 minutes but these may vary. You could win one of five ¬£50 Amazon vouchers for fully engaging in the study (Spam responses will not be included in the study or the prize draw). You may find the study particularly interesting if you feel you would like to live more authentically.Please click the link below for more information or to get started.<a href=""https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3kLZ22KaIEdeC10"">https://chesterpsychology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3kLZ22KaIEdeC10</a>",0,0,1,0
"Ive basically been out sick from life for... well, years. 2016 I got physically very unwell and suffered some neurological damage. Recently Ive been making a concerted effort to get back to some semblance of normality, Ive generally improved since I first got sick but recently Ive been improved enough to really kick start things. Im eating better, Ive been losing weight (31lbs so far, many more to go but Ive got into a good rhythm with it and my joints/body feel better already), Im doing much better with sleep (as well as someone with autism can, anyway). The last big hurdle is going back to the dentist - when I was really ill, all semblance of dental hygiene went out of the window. I was focusing on just getting through each day, looking after myself just wasnt on my list of priorities. I was, at best, brushing my teeth maybe once a month. I overhauled everything about 18 months ago, going from next to no routine to brushing twice a day, flossing with string floss and a Waterpik, plus using mouthwash. I know some damage has been done, my gums have receded in places, a couple of my teeth are mobile. Im absolutely catastrophising here; what if this dentist is rude or cruel, what if I need to have teeth taken out, what if its really too late to do anything etc. My usual coping mechanisms like box breathing, distraction, exercise are working a bit but Id like to hear from other folks here. How do you guys manage dental appointments? How do you manage the associated anxiety? Does anyone have some encouragement for me? Id really appreciate it. Best wishes to you all.",0,0,1,0

But recently its been the worst its ever been.I keep having breakdowns i am paranoid that nobody really likes me. And during my last breakdown scared my boyfriend. I was angry confused disassociating and crying. He said its okay but I dont want to burden him with something like that.I know nobody hates me, they have given no indication that they do. But i always feel like people forget me, i barely get invited to stuff. If i join in on something with my friends its 9/10 times because i organised it. I know at least some of them hang out without me. And sometimes they say Oh OP you should heb been there it was so fun Hey do you remember the time X happened because they think they invited me. But they never do.Ive reintroduced myself to many people that Ive intensively interacted with several times. And not a oh what was your name again? But a hey are you new here Ive never seen you.

"TW fighting / gaslighting /arguing  - panic attackCurrently having a panic attack because my roommate and his gf have been fighting all day. Earlier I heard him major gaslighiting  her because she said something she ate made her sick. It made me uncomfortable but and I didnt know what to do or say really as I just overheard it from my room (we have a small apartment and the kitchen is right next to our bedrooms). And then about 20 mins ago they start bickering a bit and then it turns into a full blown verbal attack . He is saying horrible things to her and I dont know what to do its just giving me so much anxiety I cant even move. And I cant leave the house because they are right outside my door. I moved out of my parents house to get away from this exact thing and it is so triggering to have them act like this . Its not uncommon for them to argue a bit since she basically is here all the time or she makes him call her when they are apart(which imo is abusive in a different way, but I digress) its just not usually like this kind of argument ,or at least they usually argue like this in their room or possibly when Im not at home, im not sure They are moving in together in July and I am moving in with my bf soon and he will be staying  here with me for the month of June so I know I can get out of this situation soon.",0,0,1,0

"Hi everyone,I‚Äôve been having some strange unexplained symptoms the last few weeks. Done a few blood tests which have indicated no cause for concern and blood pressure tests which suggest very moderately elevated blood pressure but nothing too serious.However for the past few weeks I‚Äôve been regularly getting nauseous to the point of repeatedly throwing up, suffering lightheadedness and headaches. I‚Äôve been wondering if this is connected to anxiety as I have had bouts of extreme anxiety before and have had depression/anxiety on and off for most of the last three years. I‚Äôve also noticed that each time I vomit it‚Äôs preceded by about an hour of feeling a very intense dread the likes of which I haven‚Äôt felt in a very long time. It‚Äôs like a sense that everything is dark and closing in. I also think I may have started imagining symptoms as I‚Äôve been reading about different illnesses whilst trying to get to the root of my symptoms. Variously convinced myself I‚Äôve got liver problems/brain cancer/ meningitis/ etc etc.The thing that concerns me is that I‚Äôve definitely been having regular bouts of vomiting that have spanned almost 4 weeks.

"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a 26 year old Hetero woman. I lost my virginity at 24 and have done my best to ensure that I am safe. However, I did have an encounter this past August that has left me filled with so much anxiety over the past few months. I was coerced to having unprotected sex with a guy I barely knew. Til this day, I don‚Äôt know his status. The sex did not last long and he did not finish inside me. I spent so much time blaming myself on the full encounter that I didn‚Äôt even think about possible STDs. I never got any flare ups or symptoms.Fastforward to mid October, I fell very sick. I don‚Äôt usually get sick (apart from catching COVID in June) but it was quite intense. I was sneezing, coughing, had shortness of breath and was very weak. This went on for about a week to two weeks. I drank teas and barely ate during that time.Initially, I thought I was pregnant from that encounter and didn‚Äôt know that I was penetrated. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. I then took a Covid test at home and it also came back negative.The week I got sick, I was also partying it up in Atlanta around plenty of people, so it could be the flu. I never even thought I had HIV until a month later. I was literally scrolling on TikTok and HIV symptoms popped up. Was this a sign? From then on, I went down a spiraling cycle on Reddit and Google in general. I‚Äôm a nursing student and each time we bring up STDs, I feel like it‚Äôs a direct hit to me. I understand the importance of getting tested, but I am just too afraid. After saving myself for this long, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to handle bad news like this. Any thoughts would be appreciated. I do plan on getting tested this summer after my classes. I can‚Äôt have a bad test ruin my GPA and future career at the moment.",0,0,1,0

It felt like I was stuck.It was horrible, I had something similar to this but very minor in comparison like 2 years ago but never this bad.

"A year ago, I lived in a big city with a desirable job in film and tv, lived with a close friend as a housemate, was independent and happy. Then covid happened, and 6 months later I had a nervous breakdown. I have a very troubled relationship with my mother and brother, with whom I am now no contact. I got diagnosed with C-PTSD from my childhood experience growing up under 2 narcissists. More and more, things triggered my anxiety and panic attacks, and I began to retreat from the world.

"Hello. My story in brief. I am 21 years old, an athlete in the past, I have never measured my heart rate. a year and a half ago covid, mild course, then after 3 months vaccination with 3 doses, this triggered my tachycardia and mild heart attack, for almost half a year I had a heart rate of around 80 at rest, I took medication, at the beginning of this year it started to improve, I have EKG, holter, heart sono, everything is fine.

It was almost like a switch flicked that changed my entire brain. I still face the same issues to this current day, found some days have been slightly better than others, but overall haven‚Äôt seen any improvements. I‚Äôve learned to live like this though, as I don‚Äôt plan on giving up anytime soon! I would also consider myself a people pleaser and perfectionist now, which I most certainly wasn‚Äôt before. I feel like I analyze my sentences too much before I speak, which might be causing a part of the speech issues?But anyways, I was just wondering if it‚Äôs normal for someone to change in what seems to be an instant? And how I could set myself free and regain the confidence I once had!Thanks for giving this a read if you did, and have a good day!",0,0,1,0

"I weaned off of lexapro 20mg incorrectly last September and inevitably started experiencing anxiety again (racing heart, chest tightness, thoughts it will never end, restlessness). After going back up to my 20mg dose and being on it for at least 6 weeks I felt no relief. My psychiatrist switched me to Zoloft 50mg 36 days ago. I started getting burning sensations in my brain along with my normal anxiety symptoms. The burning improved. 12 days ago I went up to 75mg and again felt brain burn although not as intensely, ultimately it subsided. I also had my other anxiety symptoms. 5 days ago I went up to 100mgOf Zoloft and my brain doesn‚Äôt really burn but it hurts. It‚Äôs not a terrible pain but a very uncomfortable one. In 6 days I will be at the 6 week mark of starting the Zoloft. I feel like it might not be helping me and might be making me feel worse (the brain stuff is very annoying and unsettling).

"Hello Reddit,I am a 25-year-old man who had a stress breakdown 10 months ago while on vacation in Tanzania. I ended up in the hospital for a week before we flew back home (which was also a huge challenge because I was feeling so terrible). While in the hospital in Tanzania, they discovered (by chance) that I had a congenital heart defect (Wolff Parkinson White), which I have since had ablated back home in Denmark (so everything is as it should be). The breakdown instead came from me having too much stress in my daily life in the last few years.However, the entire episode in Tanzania and the ablation have caused me to have a large amount of anxiety, which really affects my daily life. I think a lot about my health and body, and my entire normal daily routine has become my second priority. I feel like Im walking around in a bubble and trying to get out of it. Something that I have experienced that particularly affects me is that my thoughts are very focused on my health and I dont really think about what is going on around me. I have a lot of difficulty sleeping alone, I have started to skip events and things that I normally loved to do, and I have generally started to have more negative/sad thoughts, which is very unlike me, as Im usually a very positive and energic person. Furthermore i also experience symptoms such as PVCS (extra heartbeats) which really affects my anxiety aswell.My question to you is, have you experienced something similar to what I am experiencing, and what have you do to get rid of this stuck anxiety, and get back to your old self . Furthermore i was wondering if there is any hope of returning to your old and positive self, without all this anxiety.If you need any further information about me, please let me know:-)Best regards",0,0,1,0

"Hiya, hope you are doing well today.Ive had this issue for a couple years where I go through these anxious periods where I will  have a busy day and have exercised and am exhausted, but then I wake up in a panicked state an hour after falling asleep. Its an awful feeling, and then its very difficult to get back to sleep because my heart is racing and Im in a panicky state of mind. Alongside that, I (36/M) will often be delusional/confused, but its always the same scenario where I think like 5 to 30 people are watching me or are about to come in my room, and I need to put on clothes in a hurry (sleeping on my underwear) or it will be very embarrassing. Such a weird repeating delusion! The scenario is actually humorous when I think about it later, but the feelings of fear and panic are real and very unpleasant when all this is happening. Almost like a reoccurring dream or nightmare, but I am awake and panicking.

"TLDR: I seem to have symptoms related to GAD such as heart-pounding, feeling on edge, but the most importantly ,the feeling of something is wrong on my chest. However, I do not worry about anything. Therefore, I cannot be sure that whether my mental problem is GAD.&#x200B;I had first experience with anxiety around 5 years ago. I was thinking I might be having heart attack, and my arms and feet felt tingling at the highest. Even in those days, I couldnt understand why I was having these symptoms because I wasnt worring about anything. Yet, I suspected that it might be psychological and went to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. I used Effexor XR, which had strong side effects but it worked in the long run....  At least, that was what I thought.<br/> It kept coming back time to time. I used SSRIs and went to a shrink and it seemed I found the reason.  I tested my thyroid hormones and  learned that nothing was wrong. Last year was the worst days of my life. I managed to overcome those days and it was a great success for me but... it didnt stop.In recent months, Ive been feeling as if everything is a task and I feel emotionally numb. I push myself to socialize and do stuff but it doesnt feel like I am living. There is always this something is wrong feeling on my chest. My question is the following:  Do I have general anxity disorder? What can I do about it? I regularly meditate and try to do aerobic exercises. I drink coffe but do not consume it excessively, and it doesnt seem to be affecting the feeling on my chest.  Note: I highly suspect that I have also ADHD but I must wait till July to be sure.

I‚Äôm 35 years old. I have been diagnosed having GAD from the age of 14. A stressful event triggered that in me. After that I am always having a burning sensation in stomach and that affects my cognitive functions and that triggers anxiety. I managed that with progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing and all for 9 years. Then after some stressful events I started taking antidepressant (escitalopram) and that really changed my life and I felt alright in life. But sometimes med stops working and I get the problems back. I have been in ADs for 11 years and now they stopped working and I‚Äôm back in hell now. Doctors tried many meds and I tried mindfulness meditation etc with no success. I told my pdoc that all my problems start from my stomach and he advised me to see a gastro. I did an endoscopy and it was found that I was having reflux esophagitis grade C. Then I realised that my stomach  burning was due to acid reflux. Dr started me on PPI two times but my problems didn‚Äôt improve. I got another endoscopy after few months and it said my esophagitis is healed but my burning stomach and anxiety haven‚Äôt improved. I did an esophagal manometry and they found that I‚Äôm having gerd with lax LES and weak esophagal motility. The doc gave me med for weak motility and a PPI but my problems are not improving.I am really confused about whether my anxiety is causing acid reflux or vice versa. I get nervous in stressful situations and I get the burning stomach but I don‚Äôt worry about health or future etc. Can the gerd/stomach burning be the cause of anxiety?

I just feel, exhausted, anxious and lethargic. Im not okay now. I wanted to be ok again. Not great or amazing, just ok. I dont think he even realized what he has done",0,0,1,0

"2 weeks ago I (M19) lived to the day my childhood friend ( M21) died in. 5 weeks ago i knew he had a car accident and was instantly transferred to ICU. Reckless driver just drove into his car from the rear and that was on the highway so my friend was going like 90km and the man was doing 120 ( estimated) that pushed my friends car to the cement blocks on the side and the car just took the cement block off and kept moving for a few meter before stopping. He had internal bleeding and crack in his skull and a few days later he was in a coma. when I knew that he was in come I was very anxious and just didnt wanna believe it. A friend of ours was going to the hospital to visit him and a couple of hours before going there I cancelled i cause I didnt have the ability to go see him in that situation. I kept believing that he is gonna be fine and that didnt happen. I still remember every memory we had together. I cant move on what happened, whenever I do something that brings me joy something tells me that Im not a loyal friend if Im not sad for what happened. However i say if he was alive he wouldnt want me to be sad.I didnt have a older brother but he was my older brother and I was his younger one. I still remember when he used to come to pick me up from my home to go to the club to attend the scouts meeting every week and before going to the club we would stop and buy breakfast and he used to make the order and stand in line for me and even he paid for it many times, and when i try to pay him back he always told me no we youre my little brother.

My anxiety was once again manageable up until this year, as I am about to graduate from university. My anxiety has once again flown out of control. Can anyone relate to this as a trigger for anxiety?

I havent really met his family and for some reason im scared to run into them in public because ive never met them and because of how our relationship is, thats a huge thing that drives my anxiety and I wish it didnt.I dont understand why its so difficult for me to simply have a small interaction with someone in public but the unknown of who I can run into its driving me crazy and ive been avoiding doing simple tasks like going into a grocery store for things I need. I even quit my last retail job due to this reason. I know working out and improving my body would help me so much its something Ive always wanted to do but of course this anxiety doesnt allow me to go to the gym. Its to the point where im considering looking for an anxiety medication idk what to do.",0,0,1,0

After ending an unhealthy marriage after a decade, I have a creeping fear in the back of my mind that I can trust no one, a partner will eventually leave, and people are liars.

His house is big enough for everyone and it‚Äôs a better location. Everyone is excited about the move, and I was too- until the pressure from getting the house ready to sell kicked in.

I have been running the show seamlessly at home as a single working parent to great praise from all. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how you do it‚Äô is something I hear constantly to my great irritation.

My psychiatrist put me on 10mg propranolol which I havent taken yet bc im afraid its gonna lower my heart rate too much or my bp. Has anyone taken this and it helped with the dizzy feelings and stuff? I have anxiety about taking pills which sucks.

This only lasts like 30 seconds. My heart will stay in the low 100s for a bit and I feel uneasy afterwards. I have 1 doc saying just panic attacks.

"Hello, I‚Äôm looking for some advice. I‚Äôll try my best to keep this brief. I‚Äôm in my mid 20‚Äôs. I started experiencing anxiety in college (think age 20, 21). I‚Äôve always been an ‚Äúanxious‚Äù person but what I was experiencing in college was more difficult to handle. Anxiety runs in the family and I know social media plays a big role in my anxiety as well. I was on and of SSRI‚Äôs for about 4 years. And I mean frequently off and on because I didn‚Äôt like how disconnected I felt while on them. Even on a lose dose. I‚Äôve been off them for 3 months at this point and I‚Äôm keeping firm on my decision to stay off of them due to those side effects. With that I was totally expecting to have a  ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù with my anxiety. I just wanted to see if I could handle it differently. I‚Äôve been exercising, meditating, and eating right. It has made a difference. But here is where we get to my problem. I do those things I mentioned above to help with my anxiety and it does work, just not constantly. I find that I‚Äôm switching from a very anxious mindset to a calm one a couple of times a day and it‚Äôs difficult to manage. I‚Äôve read that staying present in the moment in your life is where you‚Äôll find less anxiety. But we don‚Äôt really live in a world where I can just not plan ahead or reflect on the past. So I want to find a way to be able to tap into it without spiraling when I need too and I want to be able to be happy not thinking about anything but what‚Äôs happening here and now without feeling like I‚Äôm not thinking about something that I should be. <sup>^</sup> and my inability right now to figure that out is giving me stress. I‚Äôd appreciate any thoughts about this. Thanks!",0,0,1,0

As the tittle says. How can I look for a good Therapist?Ive suffered of Anxiety for around 8 years now and Its getting to the point that Im tired of it. So Ive decided that its time to see someone.

"I dont really know what this is and I just now thought maybe its an anxiety attack. This doesnt happen every night or anything but its happened sort of often in the past few years. What I noticed about it first is that its like my eyes are trying to open while Im sleeping and that prompts the anxiety. Maybe the anxiety comes first, I dont know but to me it always feels like in the dream, my eyes are kind of closing/rolling back in my head but it feels like my eyes are trying to open but they cant. I start breathing really fast and I hear myself freaking out. Sometimes this will wake me up but not all the time. If it does wake me up, Im pretty much fine once I catch my breath, I dont keep freaking out. Otherwise I just have a realization when I wake up in the morning like, oh yeah I remember freaking out last night in my sleep.",0,0,1,0
(26M) Currently living with my parents. I was living by myself but because of this economy my parents had to leave their house and come and live with me. We are a Hispanic family that have been living in the states for around 8 years now. And since I came to the US Ive suffer of Anxiety. The currently situation thats causing me anxiety is that we are trying to buy a house but at this moment Im on my worst economy situation. But we still are going through with the purchase. Ive not put a single dollar into this but there is so much going on that I dont feel comfortable buying a house. Ive talked to my parents about this but they insist that we should keep doing it. The only thing that Im putting it is my credit because my dads credit isnt the best. I owe my life to my parents and no matter what anybody says I owe him so much and I want to do this for them. But I feel like this is not the right moment to buy a house and everything its happening so fast that its causing me so much anxiety. I feel like if we try to do this later it would be more beneficial for us. But my parents think that this is the right moment to buy a house and things would get worst on the future. Should I be worried about this big decision or should I just keep doing it since they might be right about whats going on.,0,0,1,0
"For example, I am about to change jobs and my spouse and I decided to spend time for a week before my new jobs start. But my parents also moved here just this past week and want to see me.Today I met up somewhere with my parents to shop together, and then we considered lunch together. I asked my spouse what he thought (he stayed back to sleep in, my parents are early birds) and told him I value our time together and dont want to cut into our reserve time, should I do lunch with parents? He said yes go for it, hes stretching eating etc itll make them happy.I said OK and I was OK but then between lunch and shopping parents went to rest so as soon as I was alone in my car I started freaking out. What if my spouse is secretly resentful and Im cutting into our time together? Shouldnt I be there because my parents moved here so Ill get more time with them anyway? But if I cancel lunch theyd be sad and disappointed. So there was in inner battle of who to make happy and how can I be happy. So I cried in my car a bit.

"TW: mentions of throwing upI [17F] have struggled with anxiety and emetophobia ever since I was around 5 years old. Whenever I was 4, my cousin threw up on me and literally everywhere in our car on the way to a family photoshoot. I had to sit with the vomit on me for give or take 10 minutes before we found a place to pull over, stop and clean up. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been triggered by it incessantly. What makes this worse is that whenever I get anxious, I immediately get nauseous and during panic attacks I dry-heave. The only thing that stops the gagging is putting salt on my tongue.However, recently, my anxiety and emetophobia has been so bad that I can barely make it through a 4 hour work-shift without having to take medication that makes me drowsy (ex. gabapentin, dramamine, benadryl). My doctor and therapist have told me it‚Äôs okay to take one of these every once in awhile when it‚Äôs really bad, but I hate being unable to self-regulate my emotions.  I need tips to combat this emetophobia so that it stops interrupting my job :(. I have called off quite a few times due to the nausea, but I am beginning to lose hours. I hate feeling tired the entire shift, but I don‚Äôt know how to control my anxiety otherwise without sedating myself. *Side note, I am on Celexa (about 50mg) daily.

"So I‚Äôve had agoraphobia for about 4 years now and it didn‚Äôt start out as bad, for someone who just had their first panic attack tho, I was bound to my bed and constantly having panic attacks from the moment I woke up till the moment I went to bed. After my first ever attack my life came spiraling down to the shitter. One day I was normal, 18 and working smoking and doing teenager shit and the next day till present.

The throat closing up feeling is the main feeling I get when I‚Äôm having a panic attack and I just correlate the 2 together. I went to an allergist and was told I was allergic to dogs and cats which I‚Äôve had all my life, certain plants but no food.

"So I‚Äôve had pretty bad anxiety for the past 6 months. Debilitating sometimes. Last night I had a random spurt of anxiety to the point I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed.

She said no because she doesn‚Äôt want to go on her phone at the moment. She asked me to come watch tv instead but I needed to be in bed at that point. I let it go but then brought it up with her the next day how it made me feel upset. She didn‚Äôt see where I was coming from. This is one of many instances that she refuses to do something if it doesn‚Äôt benefit her, or for the silliest reasons. She also has anxiety attacks recently so I thought she would understand too.

"He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, Id look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; Id just watch the videos. When he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever Id watch his videos, my TikTok views would rise. This continued for the better part of a year.However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn‚Äôt follow him back). I know it doesnt sound like a big deal, but Im 95% sure he was watching my TikToks. When our friends told people he liked me, it was clear he didnt want me to find out.

It makes me feel like he wanted to get back with her, and that if she agreed, he wouldve hung me out to dry again. I dont have any solid evidence for this, but it scares me that he wouldve done that. Keep in mind, they were already Instagram friends.Edit: several months later, he made a playlist about me.

"It feels dumb to even make this post, but walking away - I cant help but think more about the way I carry myself and communicate in brief moments.I got food from a local walk-up spot thats absurdly busy due to being Friday in a major city on our first sunny weekend in what feels like over half a year, and the place being *very* well known. When checking out I said hang in there, and take care of yourself, which is something Id love to hear when Im at work, but the huff she gave made me feel some level of discontent - as though the comment came off as dismissive rather than supportive.I normally just say take care, and I dont know if the few extra words could come off that she isnt already, and I really dont want language of positivity and care to come off as something dismissive and uncaring. I hate how much I overthink things, but yet again I walk away from something that was supposed to be a positive interaction feeling bad because it could have been taken in a way thats disrespectful, and that hurts. It feels so stupid to be torn and emotionally attached to such a minor interaction, but I cant help but worry that my attempt to be supportive may have made her day worse.I want to make people happy, but I feel my inexperience and blunders sometimes cause more discomfort than if Id just shut up and be stoic.

At 23, it is only getting more severe and debilitating, so I finally made the call to talk to my doctor. The questions she asked made me emotional as I realized just HOW frequent and severe my problems are, and how they are interfering with my life. Literally almost in tears in the doctors office, yall. She told me my results put me in the severe anxiety range and prescribed me daily Lexapro. In a way, I feel so much relief and peace...I have a diagnosis. I will have medication. I finally took the step my mother has been begging me to take since I was 13 and sought help. I dont expect this to be a miracle cure, Im just so happy to be at least doing SOMETHING. Its so surreal to have dealt with this for so long.She recommended counseling as well which I have no problem with, its just that I cant drive and will have trouble getting there...everything else she suggested, Im going to do, even though Ive tried much of it before. Journaling may not have worked before but who knows, maybe journaling + medication will help. Ill literally do ANYTHING to feel better. Anything.

"My twitching seems to have started in 2021 after a very stressful situation this coincided with my 2nd Pfizer shot.

Then one day I had sever cramping of my left arm, hands, and feet but mostly my left arm.  Pain and cramping was followed by a period of time that I felt like I had difficulty walking.  All this was followed by body wide muscle twitching.<br/>Over the next year I have had horrible muscle twitching that has been light to heavy.  My left arm and left foot continued to lightly cramp over the last year.   My arm often feel like it‚Äôs pulling back.  Additionally I am now having trouble typing using my left hand.  It gets sore faster and it‚Äôs more difficulty.  When I get upset my left arm and hand shakes violently as well and it even harder to use.

I felt the sensations my stomach makes so strongly that unless I was absolutely stuffed full I couldn‚Äôt function; I was waking up in the middle of the night eating pieces of bread to try and make the feeling in my stomach stop, having meltdowns because it felt like I couldn‚Äôt ever eat enough to satisfy my stomach and make the feeling go away; everyone thought it was an eating disorder but it wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a focus disorder. In addition to feeling my stomach in this way, I also felt every heartbeat, and my hands and feet dripped sweat from my focus being locked where it‚Äôs not supposed to be. The only reason I can even explain all this is because when I was put on an SNRI it was like I could feel my focus shifting and it felt like I was coming up from underwater, the different sensations started to leave me. It‚Äôs frustrating to me that I‚Äôve been misunderstood and told ‚Äòyou just need therapy‚Äô and ‚Äòyou‚Äôre choosing to feel this way‚Äô, when my mind physically felt wrong. My inner focus was not where it was supposed to be and I‚Äôve never seen anyone else say this so I hope I‚Äôm not alone.",0,0,1,0

"I have anxiety triggers to certain things e.g, my girlfriends house and possibly my own house. These are 2 of many triggers. The reason i believe these things trigger me is because i feel i have drug induced anxiety. I did drugs and went to back to my girls house fucked up then her dad took me home. About a month or two after, i feel i have gruelling anxiety that is triggered at hers. Also anxious most of the day worrying about if different parts of my body are failing or if i will die because of any damage done caused by the drugs. The drugs were cocaine, MDMA and ketamine all in one over the space of a few hours. I am not asking for a diagnosis, i just wonder if there are any people here who could help me control the feelings of anxiety i experience and how to chill out. I get palpitations, shortness of breath, chest tightness and more. I did think these were a heart attack so i even got that checked on an ECG which came back as fine.Edit: i forgot to mention, i am unsure as to wether this is 100% anxiety or not as i‚Äôm not certain if a one time use of 3 mdma pills and about 15 lines of C&amp;K mixed can cause anxiety etc. i‚Äôm not sure wether it is anxiety i am experiencing or wether it is panic attacks or maybe even paranoia.

"Between  March 16 and March 19 I (28M) had several rounds of unprotected vaginal sex  with a woman in Germany. Immediately after, the night of the 20th, I  came down with chills and the fever started early the next morning.   Tonsils and throat got extremely sore and red, went to the doctor on the  22nd who gave me an untested diagnosis of strep and gave me a  prescription for antibiotics which I started on the 23rd. I was already  feeling better the day I went to the doctor, but as soon as I started  the antibiotics I felt great, minus my tonsils which remain enlarged  even after finishing 10 days of antibiotics.  Probably had a fever for 2  days straight and the day of the 22nd my temperature was normal by the  time I went to the doctor.Went to  the ER twice for my tonsils, one of the ER attending told me he thinks  Im not at risk for HIV since it was just a prolonged hookup from Tinder  and not  an escort and my tonsils could just be messed up from the  strep. Steroids helped reduce the tonsil swelling, but not by much.Right now, the only thing Im experiencing is sometimes feeling my tonsils  when I swallow. No pain. Diarrhea but my diet is shit and Ive always had diarrhea. I have some pain in my legs and whatever organs are around my belly button.The  woman (early 20s) was very offended at the notion that she gave me  something, but did admit to possibly giving me strep as she said she was  sick the month prior. She had a heavy cough (which I dont have) and is  a heavy smoker. Said she was tested recently and was clean and I  was the only one she was with since the test but she also did admit to  needle drug use during a suicide attempt and thats why Im afraid.Begged for an STD screening but instead they drew blood for a general blood test.

Last week I was driving at night and got super dizzy, nauseous, and it felt like my eyes were ‚Äújumping‚Äù. It was so strange and I thought I‚Äôd just sleep it off when I got home. The very next day it was so severe that I couldn‚Äôt even stand without feeling like I was on a boat and my whole right side was completely numb, so I made my husband take me to the ER. They ran lab tests, ekg, and ct scan of my head- ALL PERFECT. They discharge me after the tests and chalked it up to my anxiety and also gave me a packet for ‚Äúinformation on anxiety disorders‚Äù which was a joke in itself lmao. 2 days later I spiked a fever with body aches and chills- still so freaking dizzy at this point. Goes to a little urgent care and get diagnosed with a severe ear infection, WHICH CAN CAUSE DIZZINESS. And finding out from my pcp that the hospital had emailed her my records and my white blood count was so low that I clearly had an infection that they just overlooked.

"I just need to rant, so bare with me. Ive been seriously struggling lately (not the norm for me, but this time around, things have felt a lot harder to cope with). Instead of coping in silence, as I usually do, I decided to reach out to people and be open about my mental health struggles - after all, everyone always likes to say if youre struggling, just reach out. or why didnt they just reach out if things go majorly south.Ive come to realize that that is all bullshit, and a facade. The amount of people I have reached out to about my struggles, just wanting someone to hear me out and provide some sort of emotional support in the midst of my chaos - only for things to fall flat or people not really care is so disheartening. Everyones so wrapped up in their own internal storms that 99.9% of people dont have the capacity to hear anyone elses.

"Hi all,I need your advice.I have been struggling with anxiety for about 3 years now. I read feeling good by David Burns and it was mind opening as I discovered CBT. Fast forward, I tried to apply some exposure techniques and it did work well. It also helped to recognize the categories of intrusive thoughts I had , so my anxiety lowered. However due to my previous job, it didnt go as a lot of situations would trigger it back.Later, I changed my job, less stress and less anxiety. I decided to consult with an expert on CBT.. but somehow it didnt work for me as I felt the book was much better and apart from the commitment to consult and try my best since I am paying for the sessions, I felt I could do better with just the book + commitment to apply (which I didnt have)I am starting to wonder if it is really worth it looking for another doctor, or if at the end of the day it will bz just similar.. giving me the same exercises I read about with no added value.. apart from the commitment.1- How have been your experience so far if you have read books and also had consulted a doctor?2-Were there any book that helped you make significant improvement without any medication3- Are there any strategies you applied  by yourself to be consistent and see results?4- Any advice on how to get out of the anxiety trouble?5- Any thoughts about the  not being at ease with a certain level of uncertainty as I was told my anxiety is related to it.Anyone with any tip on how to manage that on a daily basis :)?Thanks a lot for any input.",0,0,1,0

"Hi everyone. 23F. Around October last year my lovely 15 yo dog, which I loved the most, died from epileptic seizure in front of me. I couldnt help him. I grew up with him and seeing him suffering broke my heart (worst pain ever). I dont know if it related or not, but around January I started experience strange symptoms. I was about to fly to Roma (Italy) and I was totally scared of flying. ALso I study pharmacy and I was taking exams at that moment, so you can imagine how hard January was for me... So in January I went to the church with my parents and suddenly I became very anxious about passing out in front of them. Like suddenly in my head clicks a thought about passing out. Then I started to noticing every symptoms of my body, my heart started to beat fast and hard (pounding feeling) and really started to feel dizzy. I ran away to my car and my symptoms dissappeared like magic.Situation like this has happened around 8 times again, for example when I was standing with my friend at bus station, suddenly a thought came to my head what if pass out.... And always, when I ran away my symptoms dissappear. Im so scared of passing out in front of someone... I had some problems after covid, and I study pharmacy, so I explain every symptom as a post-covid. I went to a dark hole. Sometimes I dont know if I am making it up or not.Interesting thing is, I usually stand at work for 14 hours straight, or in the laboratory doing some experiments.. Ive never felt dizzy or anxious, because I dont focus on myself...This some sort of panic happens only when I am calm, Im not in a hurry and I am in front of somebody... Its like I dont want to embarrassed myself ...Im so devastated, because Im scared I will be scared and I get anxiety attack. Im changing a job also.

"Ive been doing pretty well with my anxiety. Until recently, theres been several times Ive struggled to remember certain things, whenever that happens it makes me go into full panic mode. It usually always happens when I am laying in bed about to go to sleep. An example was when I was browsing through my YouTube subscriptions, I remember that I had subscribed to a certain channel, but now its gone. Just the fact I forgot the name of the channel made me anxious, makes me think I am losing my memory. I believe that was the evening it was so bad that I couldnt sleep at all. Every time I laid in bed I had to get up and start pacing around. &#x200B;Another example was my significant other was driving me to work and they asked me what was I dreaming of the night before, I was crying in my sleep. I struggled so hard to remember the dream but I couldnt, I felt myself start to get anxious again right there in the car. I told them not to mention it cause I dont remember. I dont know why all of a sudden this is happening. I dont understand why I am worrying about remembering stuff. &#x200B;I am diabetic but I kept on hearing about how people get dementia if they dont control their blood sugar levels. Ive been wondering if taking medication will help with this, making the anxiety not as bad? Ive always been scared of taking medications because my body is sensitive to certain types. Ive had major issues with regular sleep medications and even those gummies that are suppose to help with anxiety can make it worse.&#x200B;My Mother tells me that there are things we cant control. I know I shouldnt be anxious over things I cant control but I dont know why, just the simple thought of remembering something triggers it. I know theres probably not much that can be done but I really hate that this happens when I am trying to sleep. I need sleep and I dont want this to be a daily thing with me.

I went to a psychiatrist appointment yesterday. My anxiety has been teetering on the ledge of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing just fine‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to go off the rails‚Äù. My therapist encouraged me to go and just see what they have to say and that even if they prescribe something I can decide not to take it.Well I was prescribed something and now I‚Äôm getting cold feet. I don‚Äôt feel like I really trust the psychiatrist. The whole time he wasn‚Äôt even facing me. He was sitting in a chair directed at me but facing to the side and kind of looking at the ground. Listen- I kind of hate eye contact but that made me even more uncomfortable. He also only smiled maybe ONCE during the whole 45 minute appointment. He also wanted to prescribe hydroxyzine instead of the lorazepam that I have been using safely and very sporadically. Like I haven‚Äôt taken it in over a month. I get that it can be a dangerous substance but hydroxyzine just knocks me out and I feel like it defeats the purpose of what it should be used for. I don‚Äôt know I suppose I‚Äôm just ranting here. I haven‚Äôt taken meds in years but I know starting them sucks and I felt like a zombie on them.

"Hi guys,I have a reccuring problem: whenever I get anxious or stressed or tense, I cant seem to communicate about it. I think its partly because Im too overwhelmed and partly because I believe that I dont need to ask for help.I live with my family, and whenever I feel on edge, they never seem to act in the best way. They say things that only make me even more anxious, and they never manage to help me. And that is partly because they often simply dont realize that Im not doing well, but also because even when they do realize, they just dont know how to help. Sometimes they do try to help but it still makes things worse.And Im not any better, because the only things that I manage to say or do in those moments are pretty bad: I usually just lash out at them when Im not giving them the silent treatment. I would really like to be able to open up about the real issue but its simply impossible to me during those moments, given that I already dont talk about my mental health when Im doing okay.I think part of the issue lies with me feeling like I cannot bother people by asking to be coddled, which, youll probably agree, is a bit too harsh on me when anxiety is a real and legitimate issue. Ive thought about having a talk about my mental health with my family, but I think Im convinced that they wouldnt pay it much mind and they might even tell me that Im exaggerating.TL;DR: Basically, Im wondering if anybody here has tips on:1) How to talk to your family/loved ones about mental health, especially when they dont relate2) How to communicate when spiraling or having an anxiety attack (do some people use a signal of some kind? Idk, could work)3) How to feel more legitimate about asking for help, both in general and in the moment of a wave of anxious thoughts.Thank you for your comments!

"Day after taking first dose of Escitalopram - I do not feel well at all<br/>I been having massive anxiety issues and worry/panic. Saw my GP in the morning yesterday, who prescribed me Escitalopram.  In the afternoon, I had my first counseling session. They think I might be experiencing some PTSD from a motorcycle accident I was in one year ago and I also scored 13 out of 20 on the GAD chart. I feel terrible today. Took the first dose (5MG) yesterday evening and feel horrible today. I woke up dry heaving the whole first hour I was awake, also had loose stools, a terrible headache all day, dizziness,  mind fog, fatigued, very  drowsy, and barely urinated all day (only twice since waking up when I normally frequently urinate).  I think part of my issue is how my body metabolizes medicines, as I take medicine for life long chronic GI issues, which affects how my body absorbs things.  I tried edibles in the fall/winter, and the effects were weird. I would fall asleep, sleep through the night, but the next day around late morning/noon, I would be in a state of severe anxiety, panic, and even had some OCD behaviors begin (the OCD has significantly subsided since I stopped edibles back two months ago).",0,0,1,0

I am frustrated by my overthinking and anxiety. Some context: Ive been in this relationship for a year now. Its been great over all. She has broken it off 2 times for only a couple weeks each time for the same reason of her feeling like she needs space and scared when getting close to someone because of her previous experiences. This last time I got back with her I made sure to be clear that I didnt want to get back together if that was going to happen again for those same reasons. She understood my point of view and doesnt want that to happen and said she will do better at communicating and not allowing those thoughts she has affect her decisions because she regretted breaking up both times. But this week has been stressful for her because of school. She has stressed herself out a lot with the couple projects she has due. She has somewhat distanced herself or it feels that way at least but at the same time we have still talked about the same amount but sometimes her texts seem distant. And thats similar to how its gone when we broke up. Im trying to logically think and know that she is just very stressed and overwhelmed and hasnt had time to talk. But my anxiety doesnt let me think that way and constantly goes back to the possibility of it ending. I feel like I need too much reassurance that I could ask for realistically. And she has still said I love you in the past couple days but i still im feeling very anxious and scared. I‚Äôve spent this whole week constantly overthinking and analyzing this situation. I‚Äôm just frustrated that logically and deep down I think I know what‚Äôs going on and that it‚Äôs not a problem but my feelings are taking over and not allowing me to feel that way. Im kind of new to discovering this anxiety and overthinking that I have in my life so any help and tips would be very helpful and I would appreciate it.,0,0,1,0

It went awful because I was panicking about throwing up/stomach sounds/just generally embarrassing myself in the dead silent hall.

"I am easily distractable, unable to focus or direct my attention to the things that <strong>need</strong> to be done. Coupled with the fact that I seem to be experiencing some sudden incapacity to learn anything practically (it feels like nothing I do is ever productive), and the fact that I have been through this before, I think my focus problems probably stem from my generalized anxiety and my stress. The fact that I cope with these uncomfortable feelings by scrolling aimlessly and bombarding my senses with stimuli compounds the problem. I used to take 10 mgs of Prazepam, and I admit that the meds did manage some of the symptoms (I was less agitated, less neurotic, more chill and laid back, less paranoid about the future) I was very lethargic, sleepy and low energy for much of the treatment period which didnt help with my cognitive and productivity issues. The main reason why Im not rushing back straight to meds is because, while in my first bout of anxiety/depression crisis, I had plenty of psycho-somatic manifestations of my deblitated mental health (stomach issues, consistent and terrible migraines, body aches, etc), I seem to be doing just fine on the physical plane now.I exercise every day, and as a former exercise-is-an-effective-coping-method doubter, I converted the instant those first bursts of endorphins flooded my brain. I was borderline euphoric for a couple of hours post workout. But thats just it. The sadness just set in again with more viciousness.

"Tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to a friend‚Äôs remote cabin for a few days to get away from the city for a little bit. I‚Äôve been super happy and excited about it up until tonight, when my anxiety finally managed to butt in and ask, ‚ÄúWhat if?‚ÄùNow, it‚Äôs almost two in the morning, I still got shit to do in the day before I head up to the cabin, and I‚Äôm laying awake in my bed, catastrophizing. In the past five minutes, I‚Äôve asked myself questions like: ‚ÄúWhat if it snows too much and my truck gets stuck and I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if we run out of food?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if we run out of wood to burn?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if I go on a hike and get lost?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if my (very loyal, very calm, very smart) puppy manages to escape my sight, escape through the front door onto the enclosed porch, escape the enclosed porch through the screen door, and gets eaten by a bear?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if a moose breaks into the cabin?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat if there‚Äôs a forest fire or an avalanche?‚ÄùAnd on and on and on. It‚Äôs fucking horrible. Logically, I know everything is probably gonna be okay. I know I will be very well prepared (over-prepared, actually) for the few days I‚Äôll be gone. I know I won‚Äôt be alone (my grandpa and a friend will be staying with me), and both my family and friends know where I‚Äôm headed and how long I‚Äôll be gone. I know the cabin is very safe and secure, complete with modern amenities and cell service. I know my puppy will always be closely watched, I will always leash him when we go outside, and he won‚Äôt be left alone for a second. I know I won‚Äôt get lost or stuck or run out of food. I know everything‚Äôs gonna be awesome, and I‚Äôll forget all of my worries the moment I get to the cabin.

I start to notice how its easier or harder wit certain people. I start thinking about how long I stare, which eye I stare at, what other spots I stare around, I start getting nervous about staring at other parts of their body. Then I start searching for all these symptoms. Could it be anxiety, trauma, introversion, adhd, autism? I dont fucking know. But its driving me insane. Sometimes its about the way I understand jokes. Did I laugh too little or too much? Was the joke even funny or did I laugh out of pity? Did I even enjoy the joke/laughter or was I doing it cuz that was the socially right thing to do? Did I miss a joke? Why didnt I think that was funny even though I laughed?

"Ive been suffering from CRIPPLING anxiety since my earliest memories and have gotten much so better over the years, but still have attacks here and there.

I quickly google Tetris during my hyperventilating and clicked the first website. Then I just put all my energy in trying to focus on the game and I just kept playing until I felt relatively calm.I really cant thank tetris enough. I read about studies they did on tetris helping with panic attacks and started using it a year ago. Its amazing how well it works for me, because my mind cant wander since the game needs so much attention. It constantly soothes me when I cant get my mind to stop spiraling. Clearly no cure, but it is a great coping mechanism to ground yourself.Anyway, just thought Id post this so maybe it can help someone else. :)",0,0,1,0
"Looking for some advice, I have suffered with anxiety for years (really badly at some points) and lately, Ive had a few anxiety/panic attacks at work.

"Hi all.So, I am that point of bad anxiety again. I have Panic Disorder as well as Health Anxiety. Over the years I have experienced so many different symptoms that set me off for a panic attack that at this point, I should be used to it.I know I‚Äôve experienced shortness of breath before. I know that it is anxiety related but I just can‚Äôt stop my ‚Äúanxiety brain‚Äù from realising that!At the moment I am going through CBT, which is helpful but also awful for my anxiety. Every appointment I get this breathlessness and worry before I go in and feel awful throughout it. I have a lot of work stress too which also may be a factor.Does anyone else ever experience the shortness of breath on a constant? I can take air in fine. Just feel breathless. My heart has been racing, which is definitely the panic. All throughout the day when I refocus on my breath, it gets worse, however I am able to carry on in my normal day without any issue. Every time I‚Äôve been tested with my vitals, I am healthy and fine. My chest has been clear! I am tempted to go see my GP if this continues for peace of mind though.Usually deep breathing helps, but it hasn‚Äôt made much difference in the last two days. I am able to continue normal activities and go about my life fine, it‚Äôs just this shortness of breath that is scaring me. I also have been having panic attacks in my sleep or stopping breathing so I wake up with a panic attack. I know I‚Äôve experienced this before but it still is just as scary as the last time.I‚Äôm just wondering who else has experienced this and if anyone can help support me?

All day Ive been noticing my neck pulsating which is more than likely to be regular but I am searching for all kinds of symptoms all over my body. Before going to bed I downed a vitamin b pill.

"17m About 4months ago i started waking up extremely nauseous for roughly 40mins before continuing on with the rest of my day. The nauseous feeling would lessen the more i burp.Some days i would even throw up, this made school and work unbearable knowing i would have to wake up feeling like this every morning for the first 40ish mins of school/work.Now not only do i have this weird morning sickness feeling, i am now feeling it at random points during the day aswell. I recently went to the doctor about this as it was making me extremely depressed and he made me do a urine test which came back clean and gave me some digestion tablets that did nothing. Today when i organised to meet up with my friends and about 45mins before it was time to leave my house i felt overwhelmingly nauseous and had to cancel and eventually threw up. I never even considered myself to have anxiety as i am usually very calm and confident and especially comfortable in social environments but this situation in particular screams anxiety and looking back on past housepartys where i would throw up in the bathroom as soon as i arrived which i just blamed on alcohol was probably just anxiety. A reason as to why i was maybe so anxious today was that last week i went to the cinema with my friends and on the way home i randomly started feeling nauseous and threw up and basically ruined everyones night because they had to take care of me and i was so embarrased and scared of that happening again.Also when we went cinema i smoked some weed and was just chilling and my friend jokingly said haha are u greening out because i closed my eyes (i was completely fine) led me to lowkey panic and then start feeling nauseous.Any similar experiences or advice?",0,0,1,0

"TW: self harm is mentionedHey, sorry English isnt my first language. I am extremely anxious about someone reading my medical records since I have a long history of mental health related doctor, nurse and psychologist visits. The whole thing makes me feel deep shame, especially the fact that there are mentions of self harm and so on in my medical records. I went to the doctor a while ago because of UTI symptoms. When I saw the doctor I realized we used to go to the same school together. I instantly regretted the whole thing because then he would have a permission to access my medical records and see the wild history Ive had with mental illness. I still went with it but it was awkward. We never talked anything about my mental health but when I read what he had written about me after the visit, I got shocked. He had mentioned my depression, psychotherapy visits and some other completely unrelated stuff in the text. Well, my anxiety has gotten out of control ever since and now I assume he knows all the ugliest details of my life. I feel so much shame and fear.Does anyone else have anxiety over this matter? If so, is there anything that helps you deal with it?

And honestly over the last couple of months I‚Äôve been making a lot of progress (able to be on the road longer, less anxiety while driving etc.) which has really made me feel good about myself About 3 weeks ago I was driving to work and had a panic attack that made me take the next day off from work and work from home the rest of the week. Decided I needed prescription grade strength so went to my doctor and they prescribed me 10 mg Lexapro.The first 1.5 weeks I took 5 mg and the first couple of days were pretty anxious but felt like things got better - just upped it to the 10 mg dose on Sunday and I feel really anxious.

I found that it tends to heighten over time if this is to be a person who will be present in my life for a good amount of time.

"Hello! I am on fluoxetine currently 20mg. I‚Äôve been on it for years on and off. I‚Äôve been on 10mg, 20mg and 40mg. I‚Äôve realized after being on and off and always ending back on it that I sort of need it. I have bad anxiety and ocd. It all causes overthinking, paranoia, rumination and more. I obsessively can get stuck on a thought or situation for weeks. Prozac helps me so much to not care so much or fear so much. It helps the overthinking. It just improves everything overall. Sure I have some side effects like crazy dreams, nausea, tiredness all sort of on and off.  My biggest symptom/problem is it is so hard to orgasm. I love sex and Intimacy. When I‚Äôm not on the prozac my sex drive is so much higher. The prozac basically kills it. I still try to do it with my boyfriend often but I feel more like I‚Äôm acting. Like I‚Äôm not really in the mood but I also am at the same time just for the fact that I want to be intimate with him? But I‚Äôm not feeling it naturally like I usually would :( I would say if it didn‚Äôt kill my libido and orgasm prozac would be perfect for me. I can deal with the other side effects.

It‚Äôs not outwardly obvious when someone else is suffering with anxiety to me but they still mention they have it.

Anxious and that their own presence makes things awkward. Like I‚Äôm aware this is in my head but it‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling and rationalise and realise that other people may be feeling these feelings also.

"Long story (hopefully) short, I used to go to the doctor too much because of my health anxiety, so over the past few years (partially fueled by the pandemic scaring me away from doc offices anyway), Ive overcorrected and have developed a fear of going to the doctor for even routine checkups. The fear isnt even about getting diagnosed with something -- its about slipping back into my old ways, mostly, and maybe a bit just fear of change. I also <em>hate</em> making phone calls, not even for social anxiety reasons, just dread the tedious nature, being put on hold, wasting energy if nothing comes of it, etc. Which I know is negative thinking because ultimately when it works, its <em>not</em> a waste of energy. But anyway. Ive finally pushed myself to go in for a checkup to see whether my thyroid or vitamin deficiencies could have a role in the increased anxiety Ive been getting lately, and also just to rip that Bandaid off, <em>and</em> to go to therapy (scared of meds after a bad experience). But my gosh, does it seem to take perseverance. Is that a post-pandemic thing, where the economy is bad enough that people have automated systems that never get answered and/or are too overwhelmed for the receptionist to pick up? Just need a little encouragement, and maybe to be held accountable so I dont start putting it off again.",0,0,1,0
"When I normally get what I think is anxiety attacks, I get a sinking feeling and cant help but cry but after having an ADHD assessment and it concluding I have the symptoms but not the disorder and then googling that anxiety can mimic ADHD has blown my mind. I also have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and today when In class (I hadnt turned up since the start of term)  I felt like all the people in my old friend group were laughing and talking about me. Could this also just be anxiety or a mix of the two?Ive also found myself being paralyzed from doing anything which I thought was ADHD too and its fucking up uni. I also thought my chronic sleep problems (oversleeping and going to bed later and later till Im sleeping all day and up all night) was part of ADHD but now Im thinking it could just be anxiety (I feel like I have to finish a task before going to bed and I can only go up at 15,30,45&amp;00 and when Im tired otherwise Ill just get stressed out)If someone could explain to me what anxiety actually encompasses (more than excessive worry and anxiety&amp; panic attacks) thatd be great.When I was diagnosed, nobody told me I had it and nobody explained to me what it means to have anxiety",0,0,1,0
Weirdly on the contrary to most people with social anxiety I‚Äôm quite good at it. But I feel like people like try not to make eye contact with me because making eye contact with me is scary or something? I don‚Äôt know just wanted to see if people relate. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an intrusive thought and most people with anxiety wouldn‚Äôt even care if this was the case as it‚Äôs all about internal confidence I know that. But I see them easily making eye contact with others but not me. So just a thought,0,0,1,0
"I have a big singing performance coming up that I‚Äôve ofc anxious about. It seems most people take beta blockers for this kind of anxiety. But if beta blockers only slow the heart rate and not my anxious thoughts (which is the biggest anxiety factor and problem) how is this going to help my anxiety in the situation? Does anyone know any better alternatives apart from SSRIS, something more fast acting to treat the mental symptoms of anxiety? Thank you!",0,0,1,0

"Hello. Im aware that this is really irrational, but I think I need some reassurance. I have 2 cats (7y and 8y) and I constantly stress about their health even when its completely unwarranted. Things like noticing my cat is drinking a little more water than usual will send me into a massive spiral of overthinking. They have always been healthy, and over their whole life they only ever had really minor health issues like conjunctivitis and an abscess. They both had health checks very recently, including bloodwork and urinalysis etc, and they are completely healthy. One of my cats has hypercalcaemia and needed to be anaesthetised for some xrays, ultrasound, etc. I was worried sick from the time I made the appointment to when the vet called me to arrange pick up. My other cat has a dental cleaning appointment in a week, that she will need to be anaesthetised for. Every single time I remember that this is happening, I get extremely anxious. And its multiple times a day, especially when Im laying in bed at night and It makes me unable to sleep. I know that this is a really common procedure, and I know that vets use anaesthesia multiple times every day but Im just so terrified of something going wrong. Can someone please share some ways of coping?",0,0,1,0
"Hi Group,Im currently in the process of reducing my Citalopram intake which Ive been on for the better part of eight years in order to swap over to Sertraline.My GP advised that I reduce from 30mg for a week to 20mg for a week then over to Sertraline 50mg for two weeks.Yesterday and today Ive been a mess.Ive gotten teary and upset at the drop of a hat and my mood has been so low.I genuinely didnt think a reduction of 10mg would affect me like this.Has anyone else gone through this?",0,0,1,0
"I‚Äôm 18M 72kg 185cm.I‚Äôm scared to walk, my heart rate while walking is 130-150. Resting it‚Äôs 70-90. I‚Äôve been to the ER 8 times each time all good. Now I‚Äôm waiting for my holster monitor which will hopefully measure this heart rate and doctors will see, but it‚Äôs in two weeks. I don‚Äôt know how to make it until then, I need to walk to my lectures and back, meet friends, I‚Äôm scared every time I stand up that I‚Äôm gonna drop dead. I feel like my body is in constant adrenaline when I walk or do some normal activity, I panic, I‚Äôm very hot and dizzy and high HR, feeling of death.My question is, is it possible to be in a constant high adrenaline state for two months? I don‚Äôt even know if this is a right sub to post this as I think it‚Äôs actually a heart problem, because this heart rate is clearly not normal, however in my sleep it‚Äôs 55-70 which is normal. Yesterday I took my first 10mg propranolol which was prescribed to be taken when needed until my holster monitor, but I‚Äôm really needing it everyday and I‚Äôm scared ti take it again because I slept 12hours today. If I‚Äôm in a constant adrenaline state is it harmful for my heart if it‚Äôs not an actual heart problem?Thank you.",0,0,1,0
"My great aunt passed away this past week and we held her funeral this weekend. A day afterwards my boyfriend decides we should take a 4+ month break because he needs time to focus on himself and that he wont tolerate a dysfunctional relationship and told me to go to therapy and work on myself and text him when Im ready to continue. Not sure if he was letting me down easy but I respect his boundaries, however this was odd timing. My family is acting pretty distant and it feels like I have to walk on eggshells as well.

"I left my last job in March and have been job hunting since.

I immediately closed out of the app and havent called. The only word I can think to use is terrified. I cant explain it. I need a job, I need money. I feel horrible watching my account lose money. So why am I so avoidant?Everyone around me asks how the job search is going, if Im getting responses, etc. No one knows I havent even applied much because I get so stressed.

"I am finding it hard to relax because all relaxation has to stop at some point. I am scared of the mundane and the exceptional anxiety-provoking situations of the future. When I do relax, I am finding it hard to care again. Anxiety, depression and ADHD is a hell of a mix. I just wish that everything was easier. Everything is exhausting and I am doing OK, but sometimes I just wish I could look forward to a day where I stop feeling nervous and/or alert about literally everything. Doing things is stressful, no matter which ones. Especially when theres so many different things to do in a week. I have already been successful at cutting down social obligations, which is good, but sometimes it saddens me how little I get to see my friends because theres simply so little time. Sometimes all I am looking forward to is being alone on my couch at night, in my safe space. Just a little rant. Its truly not easy for all of us anxiety cats out there. I am already taking meds but still I often feel alone with all the stress Im experiencing. Oh well, sigh, breathe.
