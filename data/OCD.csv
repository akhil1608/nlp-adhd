"Throughout my relationship with my gf, I had themes that center around people and if I find those people attractive. These are people that I had never found attractive before hand and that I truly have no attraction for.These themes tho have also helped cured while being intimate with my gf. The thought of me doing it with the other people would pop up and basically pull me away from the moment because I would try to fight off the thoughts. This has happened with abt like 5 people if I remember correctly. I wish I had bad memory so I could forget all of that.Fast forward to yesterday and I‚Äôm watching the movie Raging Bull and he asks his partner if she had ever thought of someone else while they were in bed. This instantly reminded me that I have done that and starting from then I have felt like shit and guilty and thinking I should tell my gf.I eventually tell my gf and she has a breakdown and asks me who has popped into my head. I had to lie and say it would be like models or celebrities. I tell her that they are only intrusive thoughts which is not a lie. But I‚Äôm scared if she asks if I have thought of everyone we know and I will have to lie. I will have to. If not she will break up with me. What do you all think abt this I need as much advice as possible.",0,0,0,1
"Does anyone else struggle with this? I hate saying it or even thinking about it but I had worms for a few years as a child and was too ashamed to tell anyone about it. I didn‚Äôt know what to do I would just pray over and over. They finally went away from what I could tell. I‚Äôm still paranoid that they are in me. If I could go back I‚Äôd tell someone immediately. I thought there was something wrong with me at the time. It‚Äôs keeping me up rn because I‚Äôm slightly irritated down there, and years after it happened I read about how they tend to exit you at night. I started thinking about tapeworms and I‚Äôm super worried I have one of those somehow.I don‚Äôt mess with dirt, but I did plant a few succulents leaves a few days ago but didn‚Äôt really touch it with my fingers but what if I messed up somehow. I would go into panic mode if it ever happens to me again.",0,0,0,1
"CW: brief SA allegations are mentioned.I don‚Äôt have OCD; an ex friend does, however. I‚Äôm wondering if this could possibly be tied in? For some background, I haven‚Äôt spoken to ‚ÄúL‚Äù in nearly two years. Without too many details, he was an abusive asshole. I wasn‚Äôt a saint myself, but a lot of what I did stems from reactive abuse, as I‚Äôve found out with the help of a therapist.What worries me is his attitude now, however. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a clean break; a lot of people got fed up with him for how he treated both them and me, including his partner of four years, and most of his friends.Some of his new friends reached out with concern over his behaviour; it turns out that he‚Äôs made me into some huge monster, with near-daily messages blaming me for his issues, or exaggerating things that happened. Me forgetting to feed my snake Sunday evening and waiting until Monday morning has turned into weeks without food or water. Me asking him to watch a series and warning him about dark content beforehand? I forced him to even when he cried. His lack of communication? My fault. His problem behaviours? My fault, even the ones he‚Äôd admitted were there before we even met. The list goes on; he‚Äôs even went as far as to accuse me of sexual assault, despite there being proof of the contrary. As I said, it‚Äôs been nearly two years. I‚Äôve seen all the screenshots of his behaviours, and I‚Äôm honestly worried for him;  it‚Äôs straight up obsessive, and he seems to genuinely believe what he‚Äôs saying. I‚Äôm not angry, or trying to demonize OCD; I‚Äôm just wondering if this could be connected to it, and if so how?The friends of L‚Äôs I mentioned were rightfully wary to contact me, but they‚Äôre listening now that I‚Äôve shown them proof in the form of chat logs, videos and more. They‚Äôre planning on staging an intervention down the line, and hopefully getting him the help he needs.TLDR, could OCD cause that? I‚Äôm honestly less upset, more worried after seeing everything.",0,0,0,1

"Ive been recovering from OCD in therapy for a while now and Im on the home stretch. I made a hierarchy chart and started working on my least anxiety inducing compulsions to my most severe. Im making this post to let you all know recovery is a slow process, but its the only way youll live a better life. You cannot shortcut it by trying to stop your compulsions all at once, youll just make everything worse. Know that everyones OCD and recovery journey will be unique, and do not compare yours to anyone elses, its a waste of time. Its okay to be uncomfortable and challenge your compulsions, I know it feels like it wont get better, but it will. Please speak to a professional, if you do not have access to one, as i said earlier try to set up challenging your OCD in ways you know you can manage. I know the process sounds long, boring and uncomfortable, but if you dont start recover it will only get worse. You got this. :)",0,0,0,1

"Recently my OCD has been debilitating. It has taken over my entire life and for the past few weeks I would just sit in the corner of my couch and just cry. I couldn‚Äôt watch TV, go on my phone, do anything. Recently I went to my doctor and she upped my prescription for Citalopram. I have been able to fight my compulsions more than even a few days ago but my emotions feel so dull. I feel emotions but they‚Äôre capped and it‚Äôs starting to become something I‚Äôm fixated on. My nightly routine takes me around 2 hours and what it consists of is:Washing my face, brushing my teeth and braiding my hair in two braids. But my OCD compulsions get so bad that it takes me forever to do anything. For the past 2 nights I have just strictly washed my face and brushed my teeth and get into bed without the usual (going into the kitchen 4 times, washing my hands 4 times, touching doorknobs 4 times, etc)Tonight I was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit too long (which even then is exhausting cause playing games make me have compulsions too - walk in a certain way, you can‚Äôt do a task until this time etc) and now I‚Äôm tired and I don‚Äôt feel like doing my full skincare routine.

I know it sounds absurd, but nobody can predict the limits of this thing called ocd. Ive been through such strange things in my life that I think it would give me peace of mind to know that there is someone who has been through this kind of nonsense. I mean, are there people who experience self-fulfilling prophecies about ocd, which could be religious obsessions? For example, you think too much about hell, you fear it too much, you experience it almost as if it were real, and eventually you start to believe that you are going to hell. Its so deeply rooted in you that even as you go on with your life you feel that you belong to hell.",0,0,0,1

Having an aneurysm or stroke is one of my biggest fears. Most of the time anxiety is manageable, until something triggers it of course (if I get sick, or get injured).Today, I hit my head pretty hard at work. It was a metal bar above my head and I stood up and smashed right into it. My legs almost buckled from the impact and I felt a bit disorientated for a minute, but mostly fine. I had a bad headache where I got hit (and still do) but have really no other symptoms.Despite this, though, my ocd is telling me to check my pupils constantly for a concussion. Im paranoid Ill lose my memory and then wont know how to get help because I live alone. Im horrified of falling asleep because I fear Ill sleep through some hematoma and will die in my sleep. I had a sobbing breakdown earlier because I was so scared of dying. I was seriously contemplating to write myself a letter just in case I wake up and dont remember who I am.

"Hello,I have been having this trigger bothering me the last 3 days, terribly, I cant sleep well or stop worrying, and the thing is, I dont know how to apply ERP to it.I would like to ask anyone who reads this that if the scenario Im about to describe sounds RATIONAL to you, please let me know, just want to make sure Im not speaking through ignorance.I went to a soccer game and took my puppy, shes about 15 or 16 weeks old. Due to her age, she hasnt been vaccinated against rabies yet, shes due this Wednesday.We went to the soccer game and she started sniffing around and licking. She licked and bit a piece of clothing or like a strip of cloth that was tied up on a fence. Then I started thinking that what if a rabid animal licked that cloth slightly before I got there? She started licking and biting it minutes, if not seconds after I got there. So I got concerned about her, thinking that she may have had gotten the virus, and since it doesnt act quickly, Im stuck here thinking that she will die in the next few months with no way truly knowing if she actually will.I have read about rabies OCD, its the first time this specific trigger comes to me, and I have seen that usually people with rabies OCD tend not to go out or expose to pets or other animals. Thats not the case with me, I am around my puppy and let her lick me on my face. My concern is her, and I dont know what to expose to in this scenario to get rid of it.

Ive been really stressed for a while, so have been giving into some daily compulsions (checking the door lock, fixing bed sheet wrinkles, etc).

"So, Ive only seen the movie Joker once, but Arthur Fleck really resonates with me. I dont think he shows any OCD symptoms, but a lot of what Arthur Fleck goes through really gets to me. Sometimes I question whether something really happened, and it hasnt happened in a while but there have been times when I do question what is real. I fear coming off as rude or inappropriate.My job is not good for my OCD Im in charge of looking for any problems with car light lenses and yesterday was not a good day because I got a bit too picky. My coordinator got pissed and my super visor said theyd double check (found one to many problems) but never did and I just feel like the week is getting off to a bad start. The irony is that my job would be easy for anyone else, but my OCD makes it worse.I tend to try and tell myself I dont care I listen to songs like Panic Room, So What, my personal favorite is I Write Songs Not Tragedies. Truth, is it is always bothering me. I remember the scene where Arthur was in the apartment and realized his girlfriend was in his head Ive read people debating whether he killed her or not but I dont think he did. Honestly, Im of the opinion in that moment Arthur just locked himself in his own apartment because he just couldnt deal with his mental illness screwing with him and I completely get that.

"(20 M) I have been fighting Pure O OCD all my life. Only recently was I diagnosed with it after finally talking to a doctor about my mental health. I have non-stop thoughts about anything and everything that overlap one another, usually music and repeating words/spelling words/sentences. With that said, I am on 3 medications after the course of several trails trying to find the right fit. These meds are Wellbutrin for my severe depression, Seroquel to slow my thoughts, and Modafinil to help my focus. This combination has been wonderful for me, and Ive done a lot of research on them to be aware of side effects. Now heres where I seriously need help. Over the course of the past few months, Ive noticed that my control over my emotions has become scarily good. As in, I can tell myself to stop sobbing in the shower over my intrusive thoughts and then return to a normal state. I was heaving, crying, going cataonic at moments, and then I told myself Alright cool and stopped instantly. No more tears. No snot or coughing. Just- blank. Like I manually turned the dial. It works for anger and excitement too, although to a lesser degree.This isnt a new development. Ive had this Control since around 18 years old pre medication and diagnosis. I know for a fact Im not a Psychopath nor a Sociopath. Im not bipolar either. My OCD does control my mental emotions however. Outward? Total control. Im only getting better at it and now Im afraid.

I am an attorney, so this is also very necessary. But my self esteem is absolute shit. Objectively, I can see that I am not dumb, not ugly and not bad at my job.

"I had OCD growing up, but it was towards things like school grades and money.Later on, I learned to control it by telling myself these things are not important as long as Im healthy.This thought process backfired and now my OCD latched onto my defence of at least Im healthy. Now I have crippling health OCD and it is consuming my every day. I dont know what to do now.

"Now this is a brand new technique that I have implemented in the past hour or so(take it with a grain of salt) and I have seen it have some benefits already to combat rumination. Basically, when a brand new intrusive thought occurs you tell your brain, We are going to put a pen in it. What this means is that we are going to solve this problem(whatever the intrusive thought is telling you) later(usually that later never comes). You are tricking your brain into seeing this thought as not being a problem. I have noticed my OCD has been trying to latch onto new themes since I implemented this. It tried to grab onto harm OCD and then health OCD. Your OCD wont like this technique. Youre tricking your brain into thinking we are going to have certainty(even though we wont) later on but right now we are just going to focus on what we were doing. Be my guest, try it out.  P.S. I didnt know what flair to put on this, so I went with discussion. Basically discussing the technique",0,0,0,1

"Long story short, I bullied this kid when I was in my early years of high school. We kind of had a back and forth rivalry, and while we both dished our fair share of shit toward each other, I feel like I did the majority of antagonizing. At the time of course, being a child I did not have the empathy and insight I have now, but since I have gained said empathy and insight I feel absolutely awful for what I did back then. Of course, I cannot take it back, even though I wish I could. This has come at me tenfold the last few years because I have found myself in a very lucky situation in life, when it comes to relationships, finances and overall lifestyle, I have everything I could have asked for and more. I am incredibly grateful for this and understand how lucky I am to have all I have, but whenever I find myself looking at all I have, I feel this gut punching guilt and feel as though I dont deserve all I have. Ive had my dream life practically handed to me, even though I was an absolute turd to people in my past. Only looking back on it now do I realize how I could have hurt that person. At the time they did not seem to have a very good home life, and I was just adding to that pain just so I could fit in and seem cool to impress people.

"I saw a video the other night of Drew Barrymore talking about perimenopause. Her periods started lasting two weeks long and came every two weeks and were super heavy.

I am terrified of someone finding out i have sexual thoughts. When i walk on the street. I have gone so far to obsess about how i should not elt such an impure thought enter my mind or that i am degrading women by looking at them that way. Once i had a sexual dream about a friend of mine and i broke away the friendship because of that. I also had a sexual dream about a cousin who i used to talk to and stopped talking to her after that. I am also scared of being shouted at by women who perceive me looking at them in a pervy manner on the street.

"I developed ROCD 9 months ago and spiraled In to an anxious mess. I had full on panic attacks and I was completely panicking if I love my partner or not, it was like a switch.

"My therapist misdiagnosed me with OCD 2 years ago due to overlapping symptoms I have and probably due to the fact that my mother and older sister both have OCD, so anyway I went down a rabbit hole of researching OCD. However, something I read about and believed contradicts your comments on another post I found on this sub regarding POCD and reassurance. I also am studying to become a therapist and I want to understand any mental disorder my clients might have the very best I can. An academic journal I read was written about a psychologist who would bring her POCD clients to a children‚Äôs playground. At the playground, her and her client would sit on a bench where they could see the kids playing but the kids couldn‚Äôt hear a word they were saying. At that distance, the therapist would have the client say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck that little girl.‚Äù By having the client say this out loud, they would then realize that these intrusive thoughts are very far from the truth, and it would significantly help them ease their anxiety. However, on a post I read, everyone was saying how looking for reassurance is always a negative thing (including a mod). In this post, someone discussed how it‚Äôs not okay for someone with POCD to look up child porn for the sake of feeling disgust and realizing they‚Äôre not into it. Which I agree with. But then everyone in the comments was explaining how someone with POCD would never even do this, and that reassurance doesn‚Äôt work. This contradicts the study I read about using this reassurance to treat POCD. So now I‚Äôm confused ?

Two months later the Hocd broke out in me, the way it broke out immediately, I started ruminating endlessly because I forgot that I shouldnt do that....

"TW: Mentions of rape and incestShort version of events because I don‚Äôt want to talk about this very much: I was a sophomore, may have got hit on by kids my brothers age (7th grade at the time) and had a new and allegedly real memory about apparently two of them trying to kiss me as a 2nd-4th grader I believe. Though I  checked my yearbook and the kid I was thinking of was a class below my brother. Different name too. Now, my brother had to be held back and repeat a grade due to his age and that boy was the son of the teacher, so now you see the reason why my brain is likely specifically using him. Here‚Äôs the thing:I‚Äôve had obsessions or at least concerns about some of this stuff. I was worried I was kiss someone non-consensually. I was worried I kissed my brother when I was 7 I believe, clearly proving I can think that young back. I straight up had a nightmare my father assaulted me and freaked out and believed it to be true. I read numerous stories about non-consensual stuff like this. To put even more on the list, I am trans and making sure I didn‚Äôt think I was because of stuff like this was a concern of mine in 2019 and beyond. Much of this stuff were concerns or obsessions for years. I find it extremely unlikely something like this could slip past the cracks for 3 years.Now, it feels real and like a normal, real memory.

I started going back to it, first questioning how that would be possible, and in my mind the possibility was that a rabid animal couldve licked that specific thing, since it was about 5 minutes after I arrived maybe I didnt see it and maybe because it was only 5 minutes the virus couldnt have had deactivated by the time my puppy licked it.Now I am very anxious thinking that my dog may have been infected and she might die while me, my girlfriend and all her family are at risk now too.Looking at the facts, it does seem very unlikely, and I dont understand why I believe it is not that unlikely, and this has been bothering me for the last 12 hours now.Am I being irrational?",0,0,0,1

"hello. this is my first ever Reddit post. I‚Äôm 19. sorry for any mistakes made. i think I have harm ocd, and the purpose of this post is simply for me to see if someone else has ever gone through something similar to me. My ocd affects my everyday simple actions- from hold my phone up, to deciding what to pick, doing normal day things like putting an object down etc as I think my hands will be oily or from other surfaces that are oily maybe. I keep getting thoughts of harming my mum through my everyday simple actions and that she will die early because of my actions.I do not want to harmher. Ive been trying to avoid less oil in her food because I am worried. Sometimes I get thoughts like oh I should press this certain button on my keyboard so then that might harm her and I get the urge to do and  it, and then I start to question why I did it and the more I ruminate on everything I do the more the thoughts happens- but what if  i think I would‚Äôve pressed that button / normal action anyway??? Like literally it even affects what words I‚Äôm planning to type. It gives everything I do an ocd turn. This ocd did go away but recently came up again. It affects the most simplest things. It‚Äôs not like I think oh I should grab something harmful and do it no. It‚Äôs literally the everyday things people do with NO thoughts at all. The most normal simple things. I just don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs gone through this.it may not make sense as I may have not been detailed enough. I cannot live the rest of my life with the potential what if- even if I try to realise that maybe I‚Äôm being over obsessive and that I haven‚Äôt caused harm. I don‚Äôt know I feel terrible. I don‚Äôt understand how someone is trying to do things to reduce harm by using less oil and not wanting to cause harm and at the same time have such wierd √ºrgers. I tend to feel guilt easily in my life hence something like this is a lot for me. Apologies again for the chaotic post I‚Äôm bad at explaining things",0,0,0,1

"Hi! Basically, two years ago I developed multiple skin conditions. Started with perioral dermatitis, followed by some sort of acne, followed by the most horrible eczema flare-up (on my face and body) from an allergic reaction. This reaction was painful, itchy, embarrassing, and lasted two full months before it started to recover. I couldnt sleep at all, didnt leave my house, eating was difficult, etc. Following this, I now seem to be developing some form of rosacea. I think the reaction just messed up my skin big-time. While I do see a doctor regularly for these things, these occurrences + my OCD have absolutely ruined my life. Ive ruined the skin on my hands because I wash them so often due to being scared of touching things that could irritate the skin on my face, I check the mirror religiously for new symptoms, and I barely go anywhere except the grocery store to avoid coming in contact with potential irritants. I live in fear 24/7 of this happening again. I can tell some people in my life are frustrated by this and dont understand how I dont just get over it. I get their frustration, but this was one of the worst, most painful experiences of my life and I dont think I could handle going through it again.

"Hi, my wife suffers from extreme OCD in almost all the ways you can. From contamination to concerns with death. Things are poisonous, she cant go to bed until a certain time to lower the chances of her being murder. Doors being locked, ect. There are a lot of different aspects of it that include her. Now, I feel like I am at a breaking point.I find myself suffering from anxiety about not wanting to trigger her. From cleaning supplies I use to my hands being washed, to body wash and things that I use religiously. I dont know if thats really me trying to be supportive or if Im trying to avoid conflict with her. But I really want to help. I see from a lot of people that that is conceived as aiding her in her compulsions which I also dont want to do. At this point, I dont know what to do or how to help but I feel like I am getting extremely overwhelmed. That might be selfish of me to say because I cant even imagine how overwhelming it is for her but Im really struggling.I recently had a discussion with her that I would like her to attend therapy or possibly psychiatry if she needs it for her anxiety. She informed that the psychiatrist wouldnt help because medication is one of her triggers (which this is true, she struggles with basic ibuprofen) and that therapy would take a very long time to help her. Not to mention that it would make things way more stressful for her trying to do exposure therapy because its her normal anxietys tenfold. Is there any other options for treatment I could offer? I settled with just saying I would like to see a couples counseler so we could work on our communication however I feel the need to ask others with her issues whether or not Im overstepping a line and what I can do to help. I understand that it will not go away and that it can be a permanent illness 99 percent of the time. But is it wrong of me to ask to work on it?

"Ive always liked how OCD was called the doubting disease. When you are caught in the state of chronic doubt, everything you try to analyze can automatically be put in question: your identity, your feelings, your values, your love, your actions. Each one of those things becomes inacessible because you try to make sense of it from a state of such intense unclarity that automatically muddles whatever you lay your eyes on. When in the grip of OCD, we lose touch with our feelings, with who we spontaneously are. And this particular event is the biggest problem, especially in Pure O. Not being able to access the feelings creates a profound split. Who am I without my feelings? How can I like myself without access to the only thing that makes me human?

"I was diagnosed with OCD about three months ago, and in retrospect I have been dealing with OCD for a very long time, ever since I was around 12-13. I had an intense fear of germs and washed my hands often, and had a big problem with magical thinking and seeking reassurance about things that in retrospect was likely OCD. But these problems subsided as I got a bit older, and essentially disappeared as I finished middle school and entered high school. This was until last November, where I got sexually assaulted during my senior year of high school. This fucking destroyed me, it made me a nervous wreck at school, and I began avoiding certain routes around school like the plague to avoid the dude who assaulted me. This, in my mind upon reflecting, reignited my OCD, and it consumed my life. I cant engage in any hobbies anymore, my skin is bleeding and cracking from constant hand washing, my magical thinking is coming back (I can manage it pretty well, thankfully). I spiraled and had to be put into an intensive inpatient psychiatric program and attend group therapy, which made my grades suffer. My therapist has explained to me that I am experiencing severe trauma over how other boys at school have treated me (I used to be bullied for being gay), and it makes me so angry how someone can just‚Ä¶. destroy my mental health and go about like its nothing. Yesterday was prom, I saw on social media this dude who assaulted me was having fun and enjoying himself and being popular or whatever, which I wasn‚Äôt able to go because I knew I would have a mental breakdown seeing that person again, and the bright lights and loudness would overwhelm me. Im just extremely upset by this, I know I shouldn‚Äôt let the actions of others steal my joy, but being sexually assaulted absolutely destroyed me and seemed to kick my OCD into fucking overdrive.",0,0,0,1

I tried to ignore those thoughts, but then caved in to praying that the ancestors ignore and disregard those thoughts. Has anyone else experience anything like this? I feel so crazy but also worried that these thoughts might manifest and come true. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with GAD, but not with OCD or anything else‚Ä¶yet. Any advice or comments are welcomed.

"My therapist is trying to get me to not double check every question when I finish a test because sometimes I end up triple or quadruple checking, and I changed my answers to the wrong ones for several questions on a final exam last semester. Unfortunately, I did not double check a test the other day and it turns out I read a question wrong, as well as copied the wrong number into a formula for another question. I ended up getting an 80 on the test, which dropped my overall average for the class from an A to a B. This puts more pressure on me to do really well on the final so that I can bring my grade back up to an A.Do many of you double check every question before submitting a test? And how do you find a balance between missing careless errors because you didnt check at all vs overchecking to the point that you change your answers because you start doubting yourself?",0,0,0,1
I got in a discussion today about people who have one drink before they leave or drive home. I had always thought one was okay and not gonna cause a person huge issues. I had someone else offer the perspective that they dont think any is okay.    I immediately felt like I had to change my mind even if I didnt fully agree. They shared some stuff that I understand their perspective. But even though I didnt agree I suddenly felt really wrong and bad for having a different opinion on a serious topic. This is not the first time something like this has happened where even if I think my perspective is still okay I feel awful if its a serious topic that mine might be different or cause problems for some people.   Where does this come from? Is it OCD  or could it be related to something else like trauma?,0,0,0,1

"I am feeling immense guilt. In a past romantic relationship I was involved in sexual acts between the two of us that many people would consider immoral and at this point I do too and feel very uncomfortable with the fact that I engaged in it. I would also read and even write sexual stories written about this topic and other things. Technically I didnt hurt anyone by doing these things but I just feel so disgusted and horrified. Now I feel like I dont deserve love from anyone else and I feel the need to cut off anyone who is close in my life. I feel like theres nothing I can do to make it better and the only way to relieve the guilt is to confess it, but I am too scared to do that as well because Im afraid if I were to tell anyone about it that they would be just as disgusted and leave me. I barley feel functional right now I cant stop crying and I desperately wish I could undo the past. I feel like Im also immoral and wrong for letting people into my life romantically and not telling them about this even though its necessarily their business since Im not into this anymore.

"Hi this is a bit NSFW. I have pornographic intrusive images about a very imoral topic. its like a video running in my head and I try to ignore it as you should but it doesnt make it stop. I know groinal responses are normal and dont mean anything, but if Im laying in bed or sitting and things down there are sensitive I end up having a orgasm and it makes me feel super disgusting and like I wanted it. Usually the mental video stops a bit after that. If I get up I just end up pacing around the house so the thoughts go on for much longer. I try to distract myself with something to do but it doesnt work. So I feel like I need to choose between having these thoughts for longer or getting off on them and they both make me feel guilty and disgusting, since either I choose will be my fault.

"I was recently diagnosed with OCD after spending 7 years of being misdiagnosed with other disorders, so I have a lot of behaviors I‚Äôve been realizing are actually tied to my OCD. One thing I‚Äôve been struggling to understand is if its considered a compulsion to talk to yourself or make sounds in the moment of an intrusive/unwanted thought or when experiencing distress. One of the biggest examples for me is I‚Äôll have unwanted thoughts of past awkward interactions or social situations with people, and immediately when those thoughts come up I will just say something to myself. It isn‚Äôt specifically me saying ‚Äúgo away‚Äù to the thought, its more so me responding to it or just saying anything that pops in my head. (Edit: I recognize that I automatically do this to relieve the thought as well because it brings relief I guess?)Another example which I don‚Äôt think this is a compulsion necessarily but I will also make an ‚Äúoop‚Äù or ‚Äúaah‚Äù sound quietly to myself every single time I accidentally get in someone‚Äôs way in public, bump into something, etc. My most recent ex also mentioned that I make sounds a lot to myself which I never noticed until he pointed it out.Mostly posting this just to see if other people experience this and if so are there any resources you have read/watched that talk about this compulsion?

"So around november I was diagnosed with OCD and struggled severely with my thoughts, like, I was seriously depressed and couldnt function at the thoughts of my thoughts actually being real. But I started taking medication for it around December and I noticed a big difference lately. Before whenever a topic came up that had to deal with my OCD, I would go into complete panic. like everytime, I got that heart-sink feeling where my face went cold at the thought of my thoughts becoming a reality. But this time, I notice when a topic comes up, I dont really get anxious anymore, It just bothers me, which is honestly great! It does bother me, and I start to overthink about it, but I notice I dont get as anxious as I used to, I just get a little scared, then the thought slowly fades away little by little.Before I used to think about a thought day and night, scared to eat because I feel like I would throw up from my anxiety, but today I was actually drinking coffee when I came upon an anxious thought, and noticed I didnt get too scared! I do have my ups and downs and sometimes this anxiety attacks might get a little bad, but its definitely so much better than a year ago, I couldnt even look at certain things without breaking down. Now, when I see certain things, yes thoughts pop up, but Im trying to learn and cope with my ocd and in a way, cooperate with it, you know? This gives me a lot of hope, and I hope it gives other people too, that ocd is there almost as like, a friend. A friend who is extremely anxious and bothers you all day with horrible thoughts, yet in the end, is filling your head with those thoughts because they want you to be safe and keep your expectations low.

"So I have some very specific things that affect me and make me feel that kind of instant aversion feeling. I have pretty heavy dermatillomania and some germ/cleanliness related OCD, so i know the feeling and i feel it everytime im interacting with or living with dogs. They smell bad, they drool, they track dirt, you have to pick up their waste when you take them out,  they constantly are licking themselves or trying to lick me, or staring at me while i eat anything, and its just honestly a sensory nightmare. I have intense guilt about this sometimes because its hard to tell people you dont like dogs. I dont hate dogs, I just find them incredibly overwhelming and unclean. But this is hard to explain to people who are used to them and dont think too hard about it.I love my gf, we moved in together and she has a dog. When I can handle it i like to say hi to him and pet him so he knows hes a sweet boy and i have love for him, but theres always something that grosses me out and triggers this extreme aversion that lasts the rest of the day. I try to overexplain to her due to my guilt when I tell the dog to stop licking itself, or when I lead him out of the room so i can feel actually alone, but I dont feel like explaining it helps. I need to figure out a way to cope with these feelings without seeming completely aloof to my gfs dog.(To clarify; ive told her that her dog is her dog, she hasnt made me take him out ever, she takes care of him, id never make her get rid of her dog or anything, just want to be able to stop feeling so guilty over my aversion)",0,0,0,1

I cant ever get out of that headspace or I dont have the mental capacity to think about something else or let the thoughts go, everything gets related back to my ocd thoughts. Only getting temporary relief from distractions,checking etc. Sometimes though and I would say and medication helps it feels like Im out of the well. Unsure how I actually got out, often feels like I didnt try but unsure how I didnt try if ya get me but my mind doesnt feel trapped or stuck in a mindset.

"I started taking sertraline around mid February on 25 mgs. The lowest standard dose for OCD is usually 50 mgs but I experienced an improvement in symptoms after only 4 days. It was like a miracle. The drug along with affective therapy made my OCD symptoms almost non existent. Ive also dealt with ADHD like symptoms my whole life. Ive never been diagnosed and theres actually a disagreement among experts if whether ADHD like symptoms care actually caused by ADHD or if theyre caused by OCD. All I know is after 3 weeks, I was able to think the clearest I ever had. I always believed I was just a naturally lazy person who took short cuts cause I sucked. But when this medication kicked in, I was so insanely productive and focused. I was able to read things and absorb the information without having to re read something 15 times and doing chores was no longer a monumental stress and effort. I just did things and did them well with attention to detail. About 3 weeks ago though I felt myself starting to slip back into bad habits and all the positive side effects are gone. I finally increased my dose to 50 a week ago and have been experiencing terrible memory, lack of focus, and lack of motivation. Can anyone relate and give advice on what to expect with this increase?

I want to bring this up to my mother, but I‚Äôm afraid she won‚Äôt understand because she dislikes the whole idea of medication for mental health and believes that it‚Äôs harmful. I feel like I can‚Äôt look to her for help anymore as much as I love her, so now I have to take my mental health into my own hands.I don‚Äôt know where to start exactly. I know I need to get the money first in order to actually afford any potential medication or treatment. I guess I just don‚Äôt know how to get things started, like what I‚Äôm supposed to do in terms of finding someone professional to help me. The fact I can‚Äôt drive doesn‚Äôt help matters either. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated, thank you",0,0,0,1
"Hey everyone, Just out of curiosity do you guys also experience intrusive thoughts in the form of your mind taunting itself. Its like my inner critic will repeat certain subjects, thoughts or beliefs that I do not personally hold which creates more anxiety. And the more anxiety, the worse it is. And it seems my mind can be very creative when it comes to this sort of thing. The skys the limit with my imagination.",0,0,0,1

I want to share with you what I had written down in my journal recently because it relates to you too and its been a while since Ive been this hopeful. Despite the amount of hopelessness you felt you still held on. Despite life kicking your ass to infinity and beyond you still held on. Despite your mind traveling outside its orbit and your heart being drenched by oceans of fear you still held on.It may seem like you dont deserve to live a hopeful life but you do as much as anyone else. So keep holding on.,0,0,0,1
"hey guys. i‚Äôm in a bit of a crisis here, and just looking for any insight. within the past 2 months, i developed what i thought was harm ocd, but i‚Äôm now fully convinced that it‚Äôs not ocd and that i‚Äôm really a murderer that wants to do these things. it started out with constant intrusive thoughts of extreme violence, but recently the intrusive thoughts have dissipated, and instead it‚Äôs a constant feeling that i truly want these things. when doing exposures, like reading news articles about stabbings or writing worry scripts about acting out these gruesome murders, i feel no anxiety, no distress, and no fear. i also have little to no compulsions, which has further convinced me that this isn‚Äôt ocd. i read about people with pure o who have meltdowns and cry over their intrusive thoughts, yet i write out a detailed script about acting out a murder and read it over and over with zero anxiety or feeling at all. i fear the fact that i have no fear, and i‚Äôm worried that i‚Äôll never be able to lead a normal life again. it feels like i‚Äôm completely changed, and my only future is in a jail cell for doing something horrible. i also feel like i‚Äôve lost any empathy i once had, as i can‚Äôt get myself to care about anyone or anything. i find joy in nothing now, and can‚Äôt see myself doing the things i used to love ever again because people like me don‚Äôt get to soak in life. everything is tinted by this feeling that i want to hurt people. any input would be greatly appreciated.",0,0,0,1

I really want to know what I should do to deal with intrusive thoughts because I‚Äôve tried breathing or thinking about it in an attempt to come to terms with the thoughts, but my brain refuses to absorb the fact that it‚Äôs not my thoughts. For example, I was hanging out with one of my friends yesterday and they were holding scissors which immediately made me think of harming myself in front of her. I like to think I‚Äôm a pretty caring and sensitive feeler so I really hate when this stuff happens because it makes me feel like such a dick because I know my friends would feel uncomfortable with it. Sometimes I feel so disgusting with myself because I know that if I was being thought that way I‚Äôd never talk to the person again. I just want it to shut up for a bit.

"I am starting Clomipramine tomorrow night for treatment-resistant anxiety and panic disorders, as well as suspected OCD. I have been smoking regularly since about 2014. Primary question: Does anyone have experience consuming cannabis while on clomipramine? Is it safe or should I avoid it?More background:I am going through a rough patch of regular panic attacks (since this time last year). It may have been related to either klonopin withdrawal during a taper after being on it consistently for 12 years, <em>or</em>, the fact that I was prescribed Lyrica for anxiety without being told that it interacts with weed. I am off Lyrica as of today. The reason I‚Äôm coming here is because my highs have not been the same for the last ~8-12 months (again, likely related to Lyrica? I‚Äôm not sure). They are much more intense and it takes MUCH less to get me high. I used to smoke throughout the day, multiple times each day, and now I can only consume a single puff from my vape pen before bed ‚Äî and if I time it wrong, my anxiety and heart rate go into overdrive.

However, i noticed some red flags and suspected this is OCD acting up such as the symptoms coming out of nowhere after I looked it up and the alter doesnt know anything about my past.I finally got to talk with my therapist two days ago, and told me that while my experiences are valid, its actually my OCD and BPD comorbiding (obsession + feeling empty). And when I talked to one of my friends about the result, they brought up an article about how people with OCD would likely hallucinate things, including this experience. My therapist also mentioned im highly imaginative, hence the space, but its not a system. Its OCD using it against me. Since then, the alter disappeared.

"For the last eight months, I have basically taken control of my life and started doing therapy, meds, testing,etc. I have found out a LOT about myself while also opening up a lot of wounds. Lately, Ive been thinking about my inability to start a project on a wonky week or random day. It honestly never dawned on me that it could mean anything until I was researching other things. For example: I just got back from a trip on Monday. Ive had back to back interviews, work, and a bunch of random home projects this week to deal with. My gym cycle has been thrown off as well as my grocery cycle. Basically, I cant just decide to go to the gym on a random day. It has to be the start of a week cycle, aka a normal routine. That way, I can mentally prepare myself to handle gym, work, life, etc. Its not that I dont want to go to the gym. I just cant? This goes with pretty much anything. I cant just go to the store. It has to be on certain days or periods of the week. Mostly, if I close at work, I cant go because I know I wont have any me time between the store hoping and work. So, I wait till a short day at work or a day off. Its always been hard for me to just do random things because I <em>need</em> a routine. And when my routine is disrupted, I have to wait until the next cycle starts in order to start doing the thing again. Does that make sense? ü§î Anywho.

"( F19) So, i know this is going to sound absolutely insane, and it‚Äôs so hard for me to talk about and i‚Äôm so nervous to say this because i have yet to find something that someone says similar to what i‚Äôm gonna say as far as OCD compulsions, but basically, I have struggled with OCD for so long and false memory ocd, therefore one day, i figured if i constantly just have an audio recorder on throughout my day, all the time, that way i can ‚Äú make sure ‚Äú nothing bad happened or that i didn‚Äôt do anything bad during the day, so all the time, i have an audio recorder on my phone recording myself throughout the day for reassurance so i don‚Äôt have to ask or seek it.

However, i never knew how to approach this problem with the audio recording compulsion, i know the standard treatment for ocd is ERP.

"I recently experienced a panic response due to my OCD. The feeling came on after feeling no fear all day so I thought I was doing fine. Its incredible how visceral the feeling is. Panic is the best way to describe it. Its so bizarre how realistic the thought feels. It feels like dread, panic, and fear all at once. Its calling me to take action and to think the problem away. Im currently smiling in the face of this fear because I realized that this fear is just like any other ailment. This fear is a symptom of OCD. By distancing myself from this fear and calling it a symptom, I am able to have more clarity now. Its so interesting how my brain argues against it just being a symptom as well. My brain wants so much to believe that this panic is reality and that I am justly afraid and that I should be afraid.The more I think about it, OCD is just a very convincing salesman that borders on coercion.

"I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to reduce your compulsive behaviors in relation to health contamination ocd. I was recently diagnosed with ocd by my therapist and we talked about how to intentionally stop compulsive behaviors and sit with the uncomfortable feelings. This is easier said than done for any behavior but I specifically have ocd thoughts around health issues (especially cancer) which aren‚Äôt really measurable or have the gratification of something bad not happening if I don‚Äôt do these behaviors. Some triggers are things like when people spray weedkiller or pesticides. It isn‚Äôt something thats happening everyday but my neighbors spray their yard which makes me anxious about opening my window. One time they sprayed their yard when my window was open and it felt like I had to clean everything. Once I was driving by a gold course that was spraying something and even though I was driving in a car at a distance it felt like everything I had on me and the inside of my car felt contaminated. I hate the thought of things used in my day to day potentially exposing me to these chemicals if they get on them, so its terrifying to me to just not engage in my compulsions (cleaning things I feel are contaminated) and just sitting with the anxiety.

"So Ive made some progress with my OCD lately. I managed to separate my rituals into concrete ones - regarding my fear of flying or getting injured, for example. And abstract - the rituals that I do out of habit, created over many years of OCD. Then I noticed that most of my rituals are abstract and its much easier for me to resist those, since there is no particular fear attached.However what I struggle with is resisting these abstract rituals that cause a thoughtless mental discomfort. And while Im okay with not doing a ritual I cant revert (e.g. throwing out the trash in the wrong way - I usually cant redo that, so luckily my mind just lets it go), sometimes it is possible to redo an action.As an example - I was playing a single player computer game and I did something the wrong way in it. Sure, I thought, I want to resist redoing and kept playing. However after three(!) days of playing I couldnt get rid of this mental discomfort of doing something the wrong way. The entire time I was anxious and full of doubt that Id need to reload from before doing that action and lose 3 days of progress. That made every game session not enjoyable at all. I ended up doing a substitution ritual to somehow alleviate that discomfort. However losing to OCD made it worse, now every time I play any game, I need to do everything the correct way, otherwise Im afraid Ill get this mental discomfort again and will need to reload and lose progress or do a more severe OCD ritual.How do you deal with that?",0,0,0,1

I know that going to the bathroom is a natural part of life and that having a thought, about anything, while doing that has no relationship to the function of going to the bathroom. Yet I feel this emotional contamination (it just happened to me) and I feel like I have to stop everything I am doing, ritually clean or cleanse the area I think I contaminated and then feel guilty about it. Sorry if I am rambling. Was just trying to get this all out right after it happened.",0,0,0,1

"Hey everyone, maybe this is me seeking reassurance, maybe not. I am a 21 year old female. But, in 2018, and logged into my google photos one day. I found nudes I took when I was 14,15,16 cant remember. I freaked out and deleted them immediately. From then on, the question of what if I sent them to someone was constantly in my mind. I was checking through thousands of photos online to find mine, googling, seeking reassurance, and my anxiety was HORRIBLE. This is all despite the fact that I dont remember sending it to anyone. No memory that felt right if that makes sense. I couldnt remember who I sent it to but I remember being against sending nudes. After a year or a little less, it went away. Now, a couple days ago, an intrusive image came into my head of me posting my nudes on twitter. Now, I am worrying that at 14 years old, I posted images and videos of myself naked doing inappropriate things. This is constantly on my mind and I am so worry that it does turn out to be true. Im checking my old google searches to see if this is something Ive worried about before. It just felt like a realisation or a fact, even though this is something I shouldve remembered years ago. It just feels like I remember so vividly something that I know deep down didnt happen. But the anxiety of what if it actually did and your life gets ruined is constantly in the back of my mind. I have dreams to chase but I just feel like I cant do that now because theres that shame and guilt that my pictures are probably online, even though I dont remember... it just feels like they are. Like everytime I try to ask myself constantly if I did this or not, I cant bring myself to answer. Its like Im frozen and I cant do anything else until I feel okay again after mentally reviewing. Just sucks as Ive been reading peoples stories of their lives being ruined because of nudes etc. Anyone feel like they have been through this? Is this actually OCD or do I just sound like Im in denial?",0,0,0,1

"Long story short Im a 21(f) who lives in Australia. I started hormonal birth control at 17 which lead to a spiral into serious ocd that despite bouncing from therapist to doctor and back, had never been properly treated until the past 3 months (exposure therapy ect. with a an ocd specialist). I am currently on a medication (Mirtazapine) that I am working towards stopping as it has done nothing for me mentally and was prescribed by an uniformed gp at a hospital vist. For the first time since since prior to the birth control I am feeling confident, healthy and totally in control even while constantly lowering my meds with my gp. However with this comes feeling entirely unfulfilled, Im a professional photographer progressing quickly through my career (manager in 2 months with opportunities for bigger roles almost immediately). But along side my mental health spiral came me giving up on my dream careers as they are all ADF based. I have no doubt I could succeed in other areas of entry (and even despite my own internal struggle with anxiety its never been induced by high stress environments, its always hightend by long streches of inactivity and boredem such as in covid and Ive been mentally at my best in fast paced jobs) I just am almost certain that my history would automatically exclude me.The roles I am looking at specifically are Air Force intelligence and signals based roles. Spending the next few years working on getting medication free and entirely self managed/in remission is my goal regardless, it would just be a nice cherry on top to land my dream career.Any insight would be great cause I am a little bit hopeless regarding this.",0,0,0,1

It was extremely debilitating and it feels sometimes that I was cheated out of a proper childhood, but Ive been on Zoloft since about 2020, and Ive been managing my symptoms better than I ever imagined I could.

"So I have this thing where basically OCD doesnt allow me to have secrets/privacy. And normally, I could accept this. Ive kind of grown used to it over the years. The problem? It doesnt allow me to be a confidant either. If somebody tells me something private or thats a secret, my brain instantly goes into anxiety mode until I can confess whatever it is to somebody else. It even does this for stuff that, while wasnt stated as a secret or privacy, if I KNOW better than to reveal it, it still counts.&#x200B;This has tortured me for years, actually leading to suicidal thoughts on multiple occasions because I couldnt cope. I just cant seem to beat this no matter how hard I try. My longest at resisting it was 3 years and it haunted me, I only got release because the person themselves ended up revealing the information.I dont know what to do. I know Im supposed to just sit with the anxiety until it passes, but it takes literal years sometimes and I dont know if I can. And no, writing it down doesnt help, believe me I tried. No, I cant usually post whatever it is online anonymously.

So I am currently on probation for a dumb mistake I made last summer. I was using alcohol to numb the anxiety and depression I was having really bad and anyways I got in trouble for it. My main mental illness is my anxiety but when my anxiety gets bad it increases OCD and then the increase in OCD increases my anxiety and back and forth etc. I am drug tested. I am not doing anything I am not supposed to do. I only take my prescriptions which I am allowed to take. My problem is that I‚Äôm so scared of accidentally touching something that has something bad on it. Like my worst one is hand sanitizer cause of the alcohol in it. Hand sanitizer is all over my office and I have to literally watch it as I go anywhere near a bottle the entire time or my brain will make me think I have touched it and then I have to go wash my hands a few times. There is hand sanitizer in the bathroom too so sometimes I will wash my hands and turn around to get paper towels and take my eyes off the bottle in there for a second and then my brain will start telling me I touched the bottle or I got too close to the bottle (even tho I KNOW I didn‚Äôt) and I have to wash my hands all over again. It is turning my skin red and irritated and so dry and raw it‚Äôs painful. And I‚Äôm pretty sure the people across the hall from the bathroom have to think I‚Äôm a freak from how often I‚Äôm going in there.

I am going deep with therapeutic advice to find the root. My style of dealing with things in life is to discover the root cause of things. And because of this i just had a very helfful revelation of relief.We have intrusive thoughts that cause pain and distress but interestingly enough i need physiotherapy and during that they discovered that my deepr muscles had always been like stone and that i need a lot of physiotherapy to get back into shape meaning negative thoughts sometimes are caused by the pain and distress caused by a lack of movement and body activity in the past.&#x200B;But well whatever the answer is. It is still an interesting question: Do our thoughts cause the pain and distress or does the pain and the distress cause the negative thoughts? Because healthy people have these negative thoughts as well however with them they can push these negative thoughts away or they can remove stress by distracting themselves with hobbies also prayer works well with them. &#x200B;Anyway like really interesting question that kinda made things less worse now because there is always a root cause and finding that root is to me the goal.

"What it says on the tin. I had my first ERP session this week and let me tell you it was brutal. I was curled up in the fetal position afterward; Im not totally sure my therapist knew what to do. She says things like Im so brave and Im facing my fears but I dont think I actually have the self-esteem to believe it. My OCD is a bully, it tells me that Im a shit woman, that Im not beautiful or successful or good enough, and that I should just give up and be a man because clearly Ive failed so hard at being a woman. And you know what? I believe it. Im not pretty. Im undateable. I grew up in a small town and waited my whole life to come to the big city and meet other lesbians but when I did they were so much cooler and more put together and well-adjusted and definitely had less internalized homophobia than me. I felt like a freak, like everyone knew what they were doing and how to talk and how to act and I didnt. When I see someone being put down, I step in and defend them no problem. But when I get bullied, either by my brain or in real life, I fold like a house of cards. So when my OCD is like look at your life, would you define that as success? youre ugly and no one wants you, and no one is gonna wanna deal with your internalized homophobia and trauma. You should just cut your losses and start over as a man, I dont have an argument against that, even though the thought of being a man instead of a woman elicits the same feeling in me of having my skull crushed by a train.",0,0,0,1

There were multiple times where she would find either some corny boyband tumblr screenshots in my camera roll, or she would find fan fiction in my browser history, and she would hold it over my head for months. She would just bring it up in casual conversation to humiliate me in front of friends/family, or bring it up when we were alone to bully me.After that, I became fiercely protective of my phone, and would delete every single possible thing that could be potentially embarrassing.

"So I‚Äôve been trying to apply the method of Dr. Michael Greenberg regarding my OCD to stop ruminating. But it feels easier said than done. Whenever I try, it feels as if I‚Äôm starting to block the thoughts. Let‚Äôs say, something popped up in my head that caused anxiety or some painful reaction, so I‚Äôm trying not to think about it basically. Like I am trying not to ruminate about it, but in the end the whole thought process is being stopped and I‚Äôm wandering with a blank mind for a while. Then I get urges to check what‚Äôs up in my mind or what‚Äôs bothering me, and I‚Äôm trying not to give into them. However, I start to feel a strong resistance. And I also don‚Äôt know what to think about, it feels like every thought is an OCD thought. So, in a nutshell, it feels like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, as if I‚Äôm suppressing the thoughts or suppressing the emotions, or even both. What‚Äôs also confusing for me that Dr. Greenberg said in his articles that when you stop ruminating, if you‚Äôre doing it right, your anxiety diminishes almost instantly. Which happens, but for a brief period of time, until I feel resistance in the body. Or maybe I‚Äôm getting something wrong? In the end, what is bothering me the most about trying not to ruminate, or not to think anything, is that my neck and my temple muscles become extremely tense, creating physical pain. It‚Äôs especially uncomfortable during the night, when I‚Äôm trying to fall asleep.

WORST DECISION EVER. 11 months later ive neen stuck with did i cheat, am i a monster? Am i a pervert? Did i cheat and should i tell my gf? Am i a bad boyfriend?

Be at the initial stage and stay here no matter how you are anxious, try to form a thought about your thought.</li><li>practice exposure, try to tolerate anxiety, it will pass and each time your brain will receive new experience </li><li>engage yourself in daily activities, make a schedule doing simple tasks and be sincerely grateful </li><li>communicate, tell about your disorder, laugh at your fears</li><li>have meals in the morning (especially), hunger in the first part of the day feeds your anxiety </li><li>avoid triggers (eg from family) and don‚Äôt seek support where you can‚Äôt get it even if you want to</li><li>practice mindfulness </li><li>two steps forward, one step back. Accept your failures in dealing with obsessions </li></ul>I‚Äôm still not in complete recovery, but found ways how to live my life with obsessions, even if sometimes it‚Äôs unbearable I just let them come and go away not affecting behaviour.

She has also once told me that she doesnt believe in Christianity so maybe I shouldnt either, so my thoughts would stop. Except they wouldnt. Ive also heard those basic things from her like, just dont think about them, try to do something else, think about something else. I am so done rn.",0,0,0,1
"I‚Äôm a conscious dreamer. I can leave whenever I am too overwhelmed, can identify my senses, become aware of when I‚Äôm dreaming, and observe them to absorb meanings and messages. Lately, I‚Äôve been trying to hold off on leaving immediately in my dreams when situations that highlight my OCD appear. At first I thought, they were to trigger me, like a nightmare, but now I think they are teaching me to observe and sit through it. My last dream, I was in my school cafeteria and was eating and realized my food was sitting bare on the table and before I could get overwhelmed, a girl sat across from me and we started talking and it took mymind off it rather and allowed me to overlook it. It was like exposure therapy that I haven‚Äôt been willing to do in my waking life. Challenge yourself to be uncomfortable for just a moment. Sit with the thoughts and obsessions and ask yourself how and why you feel the way you do. Replace them with something that dissolves them or distracts you from focusing on it, alone. Reassure yourself that it is okay for you to not give in to it and that you are still deserving of relieving yourself of the guilt of it. When you‚Äôre easier on yourself, I feel this is something that gets easier to deal with.",0,0,0,1

I would love to know what healthy coping mechanisms are out there for OCD and how any one else has navigated such a late diagnosis. Thank you :)",0,0,0,1

"Hi all, this has been said to me by professionals but I‚Äôve also seen it on here as well. I just wanted to know the communities thoughts because I think some of my OCD tendencies is fixed on identity (like some types seem to to be I‚Äôve noticed).Thoughts not ‚Äúbeing me‚Äù is confusing to me, I still find it comfortable and helpful, but I don‚Äôt think I understand it fundamentally.I even try to think of it through the lense of mindfulness, how it can be suggested that to find relaxation one must ‚Äúlet go of the thoughts‚Äù or ‚Äúlet them run their course‚Äù. So, when people say you aren‚Äôt your thoughts, I can see how thoughts can be just a byproduct of the brain, but don‚Äôt necessarily inform of the nature of the brain (or yourself/beliefs/personality/etc.).Am I getting at it correctly? Does anybody else have a more simple, concrete view or explanation?I am often met with people who don‚Äôt have OCD saying to just think of something else or ignore them, but I feel like it may be hard for us because the thoughts feels as though they come from within, rather than just being produced because that‚Äôs what brains do (which I think people without OCD have an easier time separating themselves from the things that they happen to think about), and this can lead to turmoil and spiraling.If thoughts just feel random, they feel less like you. But when they are relentless and distressing, even if you fundamentally or logically understand they don‚Äôt reflect you, I feel like OCD can be parasitic in that it leeches the compartmentalizing energy and replaces with fear and obsession. It feeds on the anxiety like a positive Feedback loop, more thoughts cause more fear and therefore less fortitude in one‚Äôs identity to dismiss the thoughts as just thoughts. I wonder if what I‚Äôm getting at is clear, and I‚Äôm super curious to see what you all‚Äôs take on this is.",0,0,0,1
"Y‚Äôall , I‚Äôm goin crazy . I 29 F started having intrusive thoughts about kids years ago . It started when I volunteered at a church daycare and one of the children decided I was her person , which led me to having intrusive thoughts I almost acted on but stopped myself cause I knew I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone . From there I began having intrusive thoughts that I‚Äôm a lesbian and tried to convince myself I‚Äôm not by imagining sex with girls and ppl I felt( or my mind told me I felt ) attracted to which backfired and only aroused me but simultaneously disgusted me cause I feel it‚Äôs bad for religious reasons . For awhile it was just queer stuff but then the kid problem returned again and again . I also felt sexually attracted to everybody and had horrible thoughts about it . It‚Äôs so bad now I can barely function. I can‚Äôt even look at my environment around me without seeing the shape or color of someone‚Äôs genitalia which interferes with my sleep because I‚Äôll put on one pair of clothes but the color arouses me and I swap over and over . I can‚Äôt read anymore either because my brain takes all the letters I see and uses them for acronyms for sexual acts . I can‚Äôt even enjoy anything anymore because of it and I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs absolutely crazy but I don‚Äôt know how to stop or kill the urge to keep doin this . Also I can‚Äôt be around kids or watch shows with them either cause if they‚Äôre not absolutely ugly the thoughts come again which I half want , half hate . The only explanation I have for this is that I never had sex with anyone and I‚Äôm starved for it so my body is up for anything. I‚Äôm too scared to tell a therapist cause I don‚Äôt want them to throw me in a padded cell . Pls tell me I‚Äôm not alone and that there will be a way  out of it",0,0,0,1

"Hey all! I struggle with obsessive thinking and intrusive images. I never knew I had OCD until I finally asked my therapist about it when it reared its head immediately after giving birth to my first child. Nearly 3 years and another baby later, Ive done lots of therapy work (also, many thanks to Brain Lock), andIve got somewhat of a hold on it. The obsessive thinking and intrusive images still pop up, and Ive accepted them but I feel much more control in processing through them and coming back to the moment. No easy feat, thats for sure. But every now and then, they show up in the middle of the night (between 2-3am) and it feels like all the skills I learned go right out the window and I struggle so hard to get through them. Before I know it, 2-3 hours have passed and Im still ruminating on thoughts that have consumed me. When I finally fall asleep, I wake up for the morning and have the same thoughts, but am able to get through them. Typically this happens after some sort of an event that triggers internal trauma. Im assuming I have a hard time at night because my brain isnt fully awake(?), or Im just too mentally tired to successfully process these thoughts(?). A reminder, I have 2 kids under the age of 3, which means rest during the day is a pipe dream. My number one priority  is being as present and sound as possible for my kids. As we all know, diminished sleep only exasperates OCD so Im trying to get ahead of a vicious cycle that may be looming. Does anyone have any similar experiences or tips theyd be willing share?

"I would REALLY appreciate replies to this because I cant take this anymore its driving me insane please read thank you.Ive had OCD since I was around 10 and Im 20 now. My latest OCD issue is contamination but nothing to do with germs or getting sick. Essentially for some reason there was a time in my life where I was quite lonely and what it will do is certain items I bought during that lonely period, If I touch them today (whilst I am no longer lonely) If I dont wash my hands before eating my brain tricks me into thinking that Ive kinda consumed the bad luck from that time period due to touching something from that time and that I will end up lonely again. This at first started at hand-washing but now everytime I touch something from that time period I end up having full showers, Brushing my teeth and trying desperately to get clean. I feel this is quite specific to me but this is causing me to end up at my breaking point now and I end up in tears due to the sheer stress of it all. This ends up with me avoiding touching certain things and then accidentally touching something I think will cause my life issues again and then completely derailing my entire day into nothing but hour long showers. I have gone through 20+ bottles of body wash literally in the last month and I cant take it anymore. I get so angry and upset because I know rationally that I am just falling for typical OCD nonsense but I cant figure out how to stop it.I know how insane this might sound, But I am diagnosed with OCD and im sure someone can see the resembling factors between the washing and fear of being alone.

"Hello,I see my doctor in a month, and I‚Äôve had a small suspicion that I am showing some signs of OCD. I get these thoughts (not going into detail) that cause me immense amounts of anxiety and the only way the anxiety goes away is if I find something to satisfy my mind. (Ex: I worry about my cat running away while I‚Äôm not home, so I research missing/found local cats. If I don‚Äôt see my cat, I can relax because my mind has found an answer). I did not realize this was uncommon until some coworkers pointed out my behaviors. Obviously I don‚Äôt worry about losing my cat, but that‚Äôs the best example I can give without being graphic. I don‚Äôt do any ritualistic behaviors though. I don‚Äôt do the stereotypical over-washing my hands or organization. I just think too much, imagine scenarios and then have a panic attack thinking my imagined scenario is going to happen. I‚Äôm already diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but my anxiety is getting to the point where every day I‚Äôm a worrying mess. These panic attacks will cause me to be so depressed for days. To the point where I can‚Äôt get out of bed because I‚Äôm worrying so much and so depressed about it. I‚Äôve called into work because I cannot function with the anxiety. One of my parents has OCD and GAD. My grandmother also has OCD. Along with many, many other family members who are clinically diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and bipolar 2.

"The only time I did a manicure was when I was young, or maybe once in a blue moon, ie. going on holiday etc. Subsequently, I was working backend in the F n B industry hence I couldnt paint my nails/keep long nails. But I was ok with it since I wasnt into manicures.But anyway I developed an occupational hazard after working on the job - fear of contamination and having to wipe, wash and sanitise things and wash my hands repeatedly. Before my contamination fear got bad, I used nail sticker sheets and would get so disgusted after I took a shit, because I felt that germs/bacteria would be trapped under my fingers. Or God forbid, actual poop. (Or in between the stickers and my fingers)I see a lot of girls with nice, long nails, and I would like to try getting gelish nails, probably short ones not long ones. I am thinking perhaps having short, basic painted nails or just short gelish nails would be good since there isnt a gap for the bacteria/germs/dirt to get trapped underneath my nails. But not sure if my fear of contamination would make me fear poop getting on my nail itself and having to remove the manicure, if you know what i mean. I am thinking...hmm perhaps a feet manicure would be the easiest. Sigh. &gt;&lt;Apparently, the doctor doesnt think that I have reached the clinical threshold to be diagnosed as OCD, hence, I dont use the word contamination OCD.

Since Ive known him hes been able to manage it with medication, able to let thoughts pass without having to check things, now its like he gets lost in his head all day and night. A little over 1.5+ years ago he started checking and rechecking things, sitting for hours last in thoughts, wasnt taking care of himself because he couldnt get unstuck. In Feb and July last year he spent about 2 weeks in the hospital psych ward adjusting medications and each time he was released he was on the way back to his baseline. He is now in the hospital again. Hes in a deep depression in addition to being stuck, so trying a new med again. He has a mental health care manager and he described it as catatonic behavior.He wont tell me what he gets stuck on because hell start thinking about it again, except a lot of times is about his mom who is in memory care with Alzheimers. It seems the worse where gets the worse he gets. When he is discharged from hospital, were looking for an independent living mental health care facility that can make sure he eats, cleans, showers, etc, because Ive been doing it for the last 2 years.

"Some things I do (like counting) are because of intrusive thoughts, but there are some things I do just because it bothers me, and I feel like the discomfort and bother wont go unless I do said thing, but there arent any bad thoughts attached.Like it might be reading everything on a page multiple times before turning it, or counting letters in words, or blinking an unholy amount, or evening out my actions (spinning one way then the other).

Because I cant eat just one cookie.  But darn it I wanted that cookie!Instead, that cookie stayed on the tray in the common room for a week until it finally disappeared.  I guess nobody else wanted it either.  I guess it got thrown in the garbage.  I dont know the fate of that poor cookie.  Whatever it was, it deserved better.  It would have experienced love in my belly.I love grapes.  I eat tons of grapes.  I always take two at a time, and eat both of them.  Because I cant eat just one.  Because eating just one would something something bad day.  Im sure you understand.Now its getting to a point where I eat two every time.  So now <em>two</em> grapes has become <em>one</em> handful.  I cant eat just one handful, even though its two, because its still just one.  So now it ends up meaning I always have to eat four at a time (two handfuls of two).At parties when they are passing around the chips Ill grab two, eat them, and then quickly grab a second handful of two chips before the bowl moves to the next person.  The chip passer at the party is always like, oh, you like these chips eh?.  I dont like chips.  But then I tell them I do.  And we invariably start an asinine conversation about chips.  Then they keep offering me chips throughout the evening.  And I keep doing my double handfuls.  They seem happy Im happy with grabbing multiple chips.Lol.

I was going to take it yesterday morning but I read the side effects that could happen and it scared me off them but after last nights drama, it made me want to take them.So far Ive thrown up in work and my sensitivity to light has increased but I want to know has anyone taken the drug and has it helped them at all?Im in the UK so its possible the drug might have a different name where ever others live.",0,0,0,1

"Hi all, I really need advice right now. I have always believed in astrology, but tried to take things with a grain of salt, and lately its gotten out of hand. Im in a happy relationship, but I saw multiple videos this week saying that whatever I started in November is going to be coming to a hard close on May 5th. While it was referring to early November, my relationship started in late November, and I cant stop obsessively worrying that my relationship is suddenly going to end next week. There have been several other videos posted about placements I have and how endings will be a major theme at that time, especially in close relationships. My partner has reassured me that everything is fine and I need to stop basing my life relationships off of the stars because it is literally just bringing me stress and triggering me, but my mind will not let go of it. I have been through a really traumatic breakup before and I cant stop worrying Im about to lose my best friend. I keep checking with others for reassurance, I keep asking my tarot cards, and no matter how positive the response I still feel sick to my stomach. My OCD has not been this severe in a long time, and I have finals going on this week. If anyone has any advice on how to calm down and stop ruminating on this topic, I would really appreciate it.A few other things, the sudden break up thing has been a theme for me multiple times in different forms. Eventually I stopped believing in those reasons, or I saw my boyfriend and felt better (were long distance). We also have a rule in our relationship that any major decisions in the relationship have to be made in person, so if we were for some reason to consider ending things, we would have to wait until we met in person to discuss it since distance distorts issues a lot.

"So I just had a really difficult therapy session. One of the things I struggle with most with my ocd is respecting when people don‚Äôt want to give me reassurance for something. I have to respect when someone says ‚Äúno‚Äù to me. I understand why that‚Äôs necessary. I do. I completely understand that it‚Äôs disrespectful to berate someone because they don‚Äôt want to tell you something. However, there is a point where I don‚Äôt understand it. Can‚Äôt it be unfair in certain situations? What if this person is not telling you because they are trying to keep something from you. For example: I ask my mom why she‚Äôs acting strange and she says she won‚Äôt tell me. I respect that. But the reason she won‚Äôt tell me is because she doesn‚Äôt want me to know that she broke my violin. Now I guess you could say that you just have to trust that they wouldn‚Äôt keep something like that from you because that would be hurtful. So is that just the solution?

"Hello everyone i‚Äôm a 23 year old female with anxiety and now OCD. I‚Äôve suspected I‚Äôve had OCD literally since I was a child, but a previous therapist told me I just had anxiety so I wrote off any concerns. My earliest memory of having OCD was walking home from school when I was 12, and I was listening to thoughts about having to go back and touch a pole 12 times. Aside from this I‚Äôve always had some sensory issues, now have many compulsions, constant intrusive and negative thoughts, insomnia, black &amp; white thinking, struggles with spontaneity and generally just a awkward anxiety ball of a human. I often wondered if I had autism but come to learn OCD and Autism have lots of similarities. Things are starting to click and make sense to me. Started with a new therapist who immediately noticed I had OCD and has called it severe. This disorder is incredibly new to me and there‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt understand. But my life has essentially been falling apart due to it. I basically up until now have never tried to resist a compulsion. I feel like i‚Äôm being controlled and my life isn‚Äôt my own. It really affects my moods and my ability to function as a normal human. My therapist and I are working on lots of mindfulness techniques, as well as general things to help me calm down and relax. I got a OCD workbook that‚Äôs been helping a bit too. Unfortunately one of my biggest fears is medication. But I really do think I could seriously benefit from medication. My therapist actually focuses in bipolar and OCD and works with a psychiatrist who does the same, which makes me feel better. TLDR: I am just looking for some tips for dealing with a new OCD diagnosis, things to look into, your medication stories, what helps you function etc. Thank you.",0,0,0,1

Since THOSE existential thoughts died down a bit, it made room for derealization, where I saw everything as too real as Ive always described it, Im sure others would say dream-like or even unreal but to me its like someone took my vision and made it 8K resolution/120FPS or something, after that initial feeling my vision seemed to go back to normal but now I get these intrusive thoughts saying that flower looks too real, right? and then I get back into that weird feeling of being off.

"So Ive made some progress with my OCD lately. I managed to separate my rituals into concrete ones - regarding my fear of flying or getting injured, for example. And abstract - the rituals that I do out of habit, created over many years of OCD. Then I noticed that most of my rituals are abstract and its much easier for me to resist those, since there is no particular fear attached.However what I struggle with is resisting these abstract rituals that cause a thoughtless mental discomfort. And while Im okay with not doing a ritual I cant revert (e.g. throwing out the trash in the wrong way - I usually cant redo that, so luckily my mind just lets it go), sometimes it is possible to redo an action.As an example - I was playing a single player computer game and I did something the wrong way in it. Sure, I thought, I want to resist redoing and kept playing. However after three(!) days of playing I couldnt get rid of this mental discomfort of doing something the wrong way. The entire time I was anxious and full of doubt that Id need to reload from before doing that action and lose 3 days of progress. That made every game session not enjoyable at all. I ended up doing a substitution ritual to somehow alleviate that discomfort. However losing to OCD made it worse, now every time I play any game, I need to do everything the correct way, otherwise Im afraid Ill get this mental discomfort again and will need to reload and lose progress or do a more severe OCD ritual.How do you deal with that?",0,0,0,1

I have religious ocd and also pocd. When I try to search exposure exercises I often only find some related to for example hygiene or not checking the stove etc. Are there others here with ocds with similar types to me?

"Something I have really struggled with is the expectation of wanting to commit suicide. I feel like Ive seen so many people with ocd say they have suicidal thoughts, or that there is no hope. I even saw a post about someone saying they were gonna do euthanasia. Even though I dont ever want to commit suicide, I feel like I should because so many people do. I feel like its an expectation for people with mental illnesses to want to die. I hate it. I feel like it just revitalizes that theres no hope and its only gonna get worse, when its not. I get really scared because Im worried that Im gonna want to commit suicide too.",0,0,0,1
"I spent the weekend away from my house, which is use for me and my extreme contamination OCD. But of course I did some compulsions which I cant stop yet (washing my hands, washing myself several time while taking a shower,... classical contamination compulsions). And I spent the qeekend being bullied, yelled at, discriminated. It also triggered my CPTSD and now Im feeling extremely bad. Lower than I thought I could be. I feel guilty, ashamed and angry.

"For those that have gotten a control of this thing, what‚Äôs the mindset that helped you live with OCD? Sometimes the thought of ‚Äú okay nothing is 100% so then if something does happen it‚Äôs just a part of life that I have to deal with‚Äù, this is both comforting and terrifying at the same time.

At times, I am very fed up with the discomfort and don‚Äôt feel like bothering to muster energy and patience to check.

"I have been working out consistently for weeks, 5 days a week minimum. Alternating between weight lifting and running long distance. I can run over 4 miles now and have gained 10 lbs. I am really pushing myself to get better. However, I still feel sick, some days are good and some days are bad. Right now I am dealing with insomnia due to ROCD. Do I just need to keep working out and things will slowly improve? Or should I think about getting started on medicine? I start therapy in a few days. I feel like I am just going crazy right now, to where medicine sounds like it may be a good idea. Then I will wake up in the morning and be against it. My fears of medicine are that it will hinder my exercise, make me sicker, isn‚Äôt healthy, sexual side effects, and that I will lose control.This is so hard.",0,0,0,1
"Does anyone else get severe health anxiety especially at night? I become hyper aware of my body and start panicking and feeling like I have some random deadly disorder. This has been happening recently. A while ago it was a fear that someone would break into my house and I would compulsively check every single closet and room to make sure no one was in there. I don‚Äôt know why it shifted suddenly but it‚Äôs most likely due to the side effects of my medications. Anyways, I usually try to use distractions to ease the anxiety but good lord it gets so out of control. My rational mind goes just take Benadryl so you can sleep it off but my ocd is so strong it limits that. I was on psych meds but again, side effects made it spiral out of control again. This disorder sure is debilitating.",0,0,0,1
"I just got my first pet tarantula today and I‚Äôve had pets in the past before I got diagnosed with OCD (when I was a child) and I‚Äôve had no problem, but I‚Äôm just so afraid of her dying even though I just got her. I know some would say ‚Äòwhy would you get a pet if you‚Äôre going to constantly fear this way?‚Äô But I‚Äôve wanted a tarantula for a really long time and didn‚Äôt know my OCD would react this way towards it, because in the past it‚Äôs been completely fine! I keep checking on her to see if she‚Äôs in a death curl and posted some pics to the tarantula subreddit to make sure she‚Äôs looking alright, I just don‚Äôt want this to become a compulsion. I‚Äôve done plenty of research about tarantulas and the species I have in specific, I know tons about her, I am just so afraid of her dying unexpectedly or something ): does anyone else have these obsessions?

"Im not sure if it touched the floor since I pulled it back up and tried to calm down. I was contemplating going to wash my sheets, but then I checked the time and decided to sleep for the rest of the night. I also thought I should skip classes to spend the day washing my sheets, because I dont have a dryer and theyd need at least half a day to get dry, and I still havent washed my previous sheets. The rest of the night I slept in an uncomfortable position to only touch the safe part of the blanket. I thought its a chance to do ERP, but I feel like the fact that I pulled it back up without checking if it touched the floor is enough of an exposure. Its tiring. I actually had a few good days but this thing just threw me off balance. Just a vent, maybe someone has any thoughts or can relate...",0,0,0,1
