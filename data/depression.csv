"More of a rant than anything. I keep being told to push on for a brighter future, that one day Ill be happy with my life. Its been about 5 years since my spiral into shittiness, and not a single day has shown any improvement. At this point I dont even wanna continue, why bother if its all just further torment? Most people see me as a disapointment or a failure. I used to be one of the best students in my class, now I havent attended my school in about 4 months due to psychotic symptoms and I have zero motivation to do anything anymore. Should I really continue on if this is just how things are gonna be? I dont think I have the courage to harm myself, Im too cowardly of a person and I dont see the point in it anyway. If it gets too difficult though Ill think about offing myself because I dont wanna deal with this shit anymore.",0,1,0,0

"Is it normal to experience depressive episodes even after taking antidepressant? I asked my doctor but I think she misunderstood what I meant and thought I meant still feeling sadness, which of course I’m going to feel. But I’ve still been experiencing episodes of extreme emotional fatigue, suicidal thoughts, and the tons of other fun things that come with my episodes. I have these episodes waaayyyy less often now, which is great, but I’d like to have none thank you very much.&#x200B;Additional info that might be important: I have tried two different types of medication, gradually increasing dosage sizes as each failed to produce any results. I’ve been on my current antidepressant for about 3 months now, so I don’t know if I need to stick it out longer or if I should talk to my doctor about maybe switching meds again",0,1,0,0
"I started a new job today and it is amazing. Its in my field of computer engineering/computer science, with a developed company, increasing my experience doing tasks Ive done in jobs before. Im still a student and this summer job is even right on campus, with parking provided.I should be excited, and yet...Im terrified. Because Ive done this before. Only a year ago I was entering an internship with a different company on campus, for software development. Just like today, my first days were fantastic. I had tasks I enjoyed doing and supervisors who valued me. And then...I suddenly couldnt go to work, instead staying stuck in bed as if a weight was pressing me into the mattress. I called in sick most days and said I was working from home others. My productivity dropped and I hated myself for squandering such an amazing internship.That 16-month internship turned into a 9-month placement as I made the decision to step away. I had been unemployed for 3 months now, trying to find solutions through meds, therapy, etc. I have improved. But Im so scared I havent improved enough. What if I slip back down and cant handle a job again? I really want this job, but then again, I really loved and wanted the last one too. I dont know how to shake the feeling that I will go back to my old ways and ruin a job opportunity once again.",0,1,0,0
"It seems to me like most people are quite understanding when it comes to depression but self-loathing is an absolute no-go. when you tell someone how you feel you always have to say it in the most downplayed, optimistic and improvment-focused way possible even if that doesnt reflect reality at all, otherwise youll just get hate or end up on /sadcringe or whatever.

"When I stopped seeing my therapist seven years ago I thought I „beat“ depression - or at least would have the tools and knowledge to deal with „bad days“ or episodes, if they ever come up again.I was wrong. I dont feel prepared or well-trained to deal with whatever clusterfuck of emotions - or the lack of emotions - Im currently going through.  Suddenly Im not a student anymore, who can take time to focus on himself, repeat classes to take of some pressure. Im trapped in a job I hate, and finding another seems impossible because this one is taking up all my energy and stresses me out. I live alone in a city with no friends since they all moved after college. I work from home. I get up, sit on my pc for 9 hours, lay down, play videogames or just go straight back to bed as I dont feel any joy doing anything, so why bother. I go grocery shopping like twice a week, which is really the only time i go outside. Get up, work a job i hate, go to sleep, repeat. But the worst part? I know all my problems are solvable. Quit the job, find one that fulfills me (or is bearable at least), find a therapist, do some kind of exercises outside. But no matter what I do, I just <em>cant</em>. Its like running against an invisible wall over and over. Pressure on the chest like a fuckin elephant sits on top of me. I want change so bad, yet I cant bring myself to do anything about it. Its pathetic. I procrastinate things I <em>like</em> doing. And I have no fucking clue why. Of course I also procrastinate things i <em>should</em> do, which just increases my stress level. I feel so exhausted all the time. I just want it to stop. I dont think im suicidal. Im just scared I wont be able to lift myself out of this position until I am. This voice telling me that Im not allowed to complain, since all i need to do is just <em>do</em> things is driving me insane. I simply cant <em>just do</em> things and I dont know why.",0,1,0,0

He is studying to be a doctor and I’ve graduated and feel very lost in my career and self perception. I can’t help but feel I can’t amount to as much.

Ive started uni about an year ago. I was pretty hyped to meet new people and learn new things at the begining. But when i was 18 i got my first job wich overlapped alot with uni so i wasnt really able to attend it alot. I dropped the job so i could focus more on uni but as i saw how everyone was ahead of me i didnt feel like asking questions to the professor or talking to people. And pretty much since then ive been finding it hard to even go there. I always start to feel bad about how much uni work ive missed but i keep on digging myself into a deeper hole. By just missing more and more and i keep on digging myself into a deeper hole. Its the middle of the second semester and for the first one i failed 3 subjects and managed to pass the others with decent grades but i still find it very hard to go. I feel dumb asking someone for help and i realize how much that impacts me. And especially i dont want to let my mom down because she has been supportive asf throughout the whole thing... Even tought i told her about the subjects she was fine with me failing a few as long as i catch up. With that ive also stopped going out with friends and i havent really opened up to anyone. Ive just been going to the gym because i feel it calming but thats about as far as i go...and my main question is-How do i get myself to become more social again and not someone that just wastes time that he fully knows could be put to a way better use. I havent been to therapist yet even tough we discussed it. Is this my best option right now or is there another way to fight social anxiety.,0,1,0,0

I began on prozac 4 years ago, and since beginning the medication in combination with therapy, I haven’t had a real depressive episode in about 2 years, which is great. It got to a point where I started taking the drug less and less consistently (skipping days; etc) because I felt so confident that the depression was behind me, and I didn’t need it anymore. I hated how prozac made me feel boring, blunted, and I felt like I had moved on from my depressive episode. Eventually, I just stopped taking the drug.

"20 year old guy, about two weeks ago my therapist told me I was and have been depressed, and that I also have dissociation. I wasn’t even surprised. They recommend that I speak to a psychiatrist, and discuss medication.I always knew that I felt differently than most people when it comes to feeling emotions. One day a long time ago, sometime in my childhood, I pretty much just stopped feeling them. It just made sense, and I thought everyone did the same. When I’ve seen people show emotions, I just though they were faking or something. It’s like I know what emotion someone in a situation would feel, but I can’t make myself feel it. It’s not like my emotions are gone, but just extremely weak and delayed I guess.Last point: Whenever I look online, advice for depression always starts or goes to ‘talk to friends or close people in your life.’But what do I do if I don’t have that? I have no one I can trust with my thoughts. It feels like there’s so much wrong with me. I just want to think, feel, have passion, ambition and friends like a normal person. Is that too much to ask?

"For as far back as I can remember, life has not given much incentive to me. Yet, I tried. Again and again and again, it has been hurdles after mountains after monsters after nightmares and so on.For a little while, things started to get better. I found a decent support system and got much needed help. I began to feel better. Slowly, little by little, it was like color was coming back into my life. Then life catches up with you. And right as I least expected it, one of the most devastating things that can happen to anyone found me. And just like that, it all seemed like a dream, or even just a glimpse into a snow globe of what it could be like. Before, when all I knew was sadness and loneliness, it was the yearning for that same feeling I saw in other people but couldn’t understand. It was a mystery still, if it was at all possible even. Now that I know it is, and it WAS, I don’t know that I can go through that exhausting journey again to climb out of this abyss. When we fall, must it always fall back down to the bottom? At what point does the stubborn struggle to find happiness become just an unrealistic, foolish children’s fantasy? What if I just don’t? I noticed the pain is different this time though. Instead of the screaming, howling despair, all I feel is empty. Just emptiness. I’ve never felt empty before. Lonely, yes, but never empty.",0,1,0,0

It’s been extremely tough but I am honestly proud of myself for not dropping off after all of it. I also feel extremely self conscious about my body all the time and it’s often the only thing I think about. It wears me down so much and everyday it’s a new thing.

I have an extremely hard time telling people what’s going on. It’s so bad that this is the first time I have ever asked for help besides my parents. I just bottle things up and I know I should tell people but I literally just cannot. My sleep is affected and I wake up feeling like I never slept. I often sleep till the last minute and get up just wishing I never did. My grades at school are getting a little better but are still quite rough. I just feel this inky sticky black feeling in my chest that makes me want to lie down and cry. I have started to try to get back into the things I like but it is very hard. And I’ll often talk to myself in my head just thinking about 100 different things all the time like solutions to problems or wishes or regrets or wins and fails. My god my head feels like it’s about to burst sometimes.I guess what I’m asking for is some sort of advice or help, I know what I need to do but I feel more comfortable talking to you guys.

For most of my life I have pretty much been on my own. I grew up in a small country town where I was weird because I enjoyed superheroes/anime/video games etc. rather than go out an ride horses or participate in rodeo of FFA. This led me to be a public outcast where no one wanted to have anything to do with me. Fastforward now I am on my own and have no one to go hang out with I have no one reaching out to me to make plans or check up on me. Whenever I do go out I have to be the one to reach out. My coworkers went out last night for drinks in found out because one of my other coworkers was invited last minute and then invited me. I rejected the offer because I would have felt awkward being the one person who was invited by someone not involved with the original plan. I felt as though if I would have gone it eould have been who invited him.

I’d just like to be happy for once. It’s been such a long time since I felt happy and excited. It’s been since 2008-2009 that I can remember being actually happy. I’m just tired now. I’m tired of life. I’m tired of worrying. I’m tired of stressing about money. I’m tired of worrying about my health. Im tired of the news. Im tired of time moving so fast.

I can’t do “The Thing” because it would break my girlfriend’s heart and I don’t want to be that burden. She and my family would be upset that I’m not here anymore but they’ll get over it.

"I thought it was going well with the community MH Team Psychiatrist then he goes “well my assessment you don’t look depressed” (meaning my physical appearance).Tell me doctor on a fucking zoom call what does depression look like.

Do you want me to play a sick role for you and wail and rock back and forth in a corner you Neolithic fuck? Is attempting twice in one month and a history of self harm and complex trauma not enough for you? (There’s way more not mentioned). If you couldn’t tell this has brought me a tad of rage. I can’t complain to the clinical lead because he’s even worse he didn’t know my main mental illness existed (and denied the existence of it) on our first meeting and tried to diagnose me EUPD and Autistic instead bc that’s easier for him to do something with me. The help for my condition doesn’t really exist in the UK NHS yet he hates anyone going private (make it make sense you absolute fool). I told him I can’t think about the outcome of this upcoming medical appointment because positive thoughts quickly turn into catastrophizing which is dangerous given the active suicidal risk, I worked really hard on being able to compartmentalise in a helpful way. He proceeds to make me tell him what I think the worst possible outcomes of the appointment would be. HE DOESN’T FUCKING LISTEN.

"I got cocky and forgot. After 1 year of pure apathy on effexor, I was tired of the anhedonia/emotional blunting, worse ADHD so wanted to change to another anti-depressant. Im starting to think the emotional blunting/apathy IS the anti-depressant effect. 15 days on 100mg zoloft+ 150mg wellbutrin XL, hadnt felt this depressed in a year (when we finally found the right dose of effexor). Just my usual dysthymic self. Dont even have much side-effects (except the zoloft farts, that shit staaaaaank). Just fucking depressed, defeated, depleted.

Why do they act like depression isnt a lifelong mood dysregulation? Like they actually have a treatment when they dont? Its a neverending cycle of try this, try that with no end in sight, and if you even find the right meds, its only a matter of time before they poop out and youre back to cycle through meds again. Honestly, Im thinking of tapering off all anti-depressants, and start microdosing or some shit.

I am emotionally and physically exhausted from constantly having to actively push intrusive and upsetting thoughts away every few minutes when there is a quiet moment in my mind.

I struggle with stress, anxiety, and depression. All of that is nothing new. The tightness feels like you want to scream to let it all out. I messaged my therapist telling her that I either wanted to try something other than Xanax for as-needed incidents (Xanax works great initially then makes me feel extremely depressed for about 3 days after.

"Sorry for the rant.. I had to include some contextI have a lot of social anxiety as well as feeling like Im not important to anyone, no one wants me around, Im just the spare friend, and so on.  When I moved in with my roommate (who is also my best friend) I met their partner on the first weekend.  When their partner came over they introduced themselves to me as if I were an after thought, and then didnt even stop the conversation they were having long enough for me to say hi.  They then continued their conversation with no intention of including me.. while in the same room.  A couple weeks go by and their partner comes over all the time, which I expected, however, they are still at the apartment when my roommate isnt home.  This makes me feel unsafe in the apartment, and I told my roommate that a couple of weeks ago.  They seemed semi-understanding, but did say how that isnt fair to their partner.  Their partner still hangs out at the apartment when they arent there.  I asked my roommate when they are leaving and my roommate said idk and asked me why.  I asked if they forgot.  I also said either way they need to leave for my virtual therapy appointment because I wouldnt be able to do it with them in the apartment.  My roommate didnt ask them to leave, but basically said to get over it and showed that they dont care about my feelings or if I feel safe. Now Im currently in my car.. avoiding what I should be able to call a home... but I cant I hate my life.. genuinely.  Moving in with my best friend was supposed to save me.

To this day, I have no real friends, no life, no social skills, and truly miss him.He used to tell me that hell be at my funeral if I die before him but I had no chance to visit his funeral, Ive made fun of him so many times but he refused cut me off and ignored all these bullshit.

"Some quick background: I graduated in December 2020 during the height of covid. Had no internships, no full time job until September of 2022. So for roughly a year and a half I was working part-time and studying data science. Once I landed my first job I moved out of my dad’s house and into an apartment with my old college roommate. In the beginning I was super motivated. I finally made it out of my Dad’s house, I got a gym membership, I had some money in my pocket but now that spark has worn off and I’m feeling unmotivated/bored/depressed.I think I realized I need bigger goals or something to devote my time to other than the gym and work. I used to make music but I can’t bring myself to put in the effort, I don’t feel the same joy I felt back when I did produce. I used to play video games with online friends but I deleted my discord and all my games because I lost all interest in gaming. Not to sound overly dramatic but I feel like since I was busting my ass just to get my first job and move out, once I achieved those things, I lost my purpose.

"Hello there, I am 14 years old, I have OCD, MDD and schizophrenia which were professionally diagnosed by a guaranteed licensed psychotherapist a few years back, after my parents told me to stopped taking my meds, I started having brain zaps after that, when I told them I have it, they dont believe me, they didnt care and they are brushing it off as if it wasnt a big deal and that I was just being dramatic, they believe that the gadgets were the problem (which isnt true). &#x200B;I am worried at this very moment, because I am already crying from this insane and painful feeling and experience ever since my parents forced me to stop taking them, am I going to die from these brain zaps? &#x200B;I have watched several videos and read articles about them, I even showed them to my parents, but they wouldnt believe me, at least I talk about my brain zaps to some of my friends and they believed my story and problem, I hope you can help me with my brain zaps.",0,1,0,0
"My family and friends, and even roommate all seem to treat me like my grief and pain is at this point my own doing.I cannot keep telling them that I cry everyday, for hours, that the grief just doesnt stop.. and that when they see me making jokes, laughing and smiling, that Im just playing along. The moment I am alone, and often times in public where no one knows me well enough to care, I fall into a deep sadness that feels inescapable, and I burst into tears. I run to either a bathroom stall or my car.. and there I wait until it passes.. and then longer until my eyes arent as swollen..For the record, I am in therapy and take my medication, and follow instructions.. but Im simply not getting better, and I dont expect that I will for a very long time, if ever.. and I think the fatigue of having a depressed friend or relative is going to quickly set in.. so I feel even more alone by the realization that faking recovery is the only way to keep them from being pushed away until I really do have no one left.Anyway, sorry for the sad post. I dont actually think I want advice, but if you have any I will at least read it and consider it.",0,1,0,0

"Not sure if this is the right place to post. Not sure if this is even depression. Not sure if I’m overwhelmed or disappointed? Is this just it? Spending 20 years in education to finalize with a masters degree. Having to work, until one cannot even workout. Acting and playing a professional social game. High salaries, missing touch with reality - and technology eradicating actual real social interactions and relationships. Is this just life? What every child has been waiting for. Things used to be simple, safe and comfortable. Are we just accepting this as life? Is this really the purpose - how does one even find a purpose, without getting lost or trapped in the race for nothing. I miss childhood, the colors, exploring the world, everything in between - and I miss having a father. I miss meaningful conversations and being excited about new things. My family is healthy, my relationship is healthy. Money is not a worry, but why am I, and everybody else chasing it? It feels like people are just accepting reality for what it is.

"I Need Some Advice re: mental hospitalTW S/H + S/I - So I 18f have been in 5 mental hospitals and 5 residential facilities in the past three years. I’m coming up on a year home (sort of relevant) and I know I’m slipping. Started to s/h again and don’t really plan to stop, that’s where the issue comes in. I think I’ve been in a depressive episode for a few months now and I just didn’t realize it. Therapy isn’t really helping and I’m wondering if I should just have myself committed again before it gets too bad. This comes with more potential trauma and it’s not free by any means. Plus I just (like today) started a new med, so maybe that will help but I haven’t had much luck with medication in the past. Right now I’m struggling to care about leaving my room or getting better, my plan is to just keep doing what I’m doing until it goes away and I know that won’t work but I don’t care enough to try anything else. The only reason I shower is because work at an animal shelter and don’t want to bring anything home to my dogs. I don’t know if I want to kill myself, but I’m perfectly fine with s/h which I know from experience usually gets me to that point. I don’t know what to do. I have so much trauma from the hospitals and I’m worried that it will do more harm than good, but I also know that I’m approaching that place very quickly. I’d love to hear some input before I bring this to my parents because then they’ll watch me nonstop which is infuriating. Thanks :)",0,1,0,0

"This is just a vent I guess, but feel free to read.Since last friday I’ve been really down and have gotten suicidal again. I was real close but decided I needed help so I called for it. They couldn’t really help me even when I said I wanted a moment away from home since it was really triggering me in my emotions. But no they just said to take my meds and do soothing and relaxing exercises. I know that helps for some but in that moment it just wasn’t enough for me. In the end I got through so that’s great I guess.Saterday was real rough as well since I was still suicidal and I couldn’t do the things I had planned. I did go outside where I studied in the sun to keep warm. My parents pushed me to ‘do something’. With that they mean practising my sport which I had planned to do in group form but couldn’t because it would’ve been too much. They really pushed it so I went on and did some flexibility exercises but it wasn’t enjoyable at all. They started to listen to me that I just wanted to do nothing in the moment because everything was too much.In the end my father said that a routine at home would help me be more stable but that’s just it. We’re not a routine family so how will that ever make me stable if the routine won’t work?! It just makes me kinda mad that my parents just won’t listen to the fact that when I’m suicidal that I don’t want to do anything but work on myself and all the tasks I already have for school. I’ve got a full planning already and now they want me to do more which was the problem in the first place!",0,1,0,0
"I have been saying for years at this point. Its easier to tell myself this badness isnt a constant, and it is something new. Itll pass. But, it simply always is. Im tired.

Still, i feel awful, and have lost much enjoyment in everything that used to give me at least some fulfillment. Its tiring upholding all the healthy habits Ive created, and the image of being someone productive and happy to those around me.

I’ve tried to make changes for my life for the better but no one around me seems to really care anymore.

All bets are off and I feel the true risk of the situation I’m in at play. Even worse, I feel like a pond in another person’s game in which they’ve lost respect for me and I’ve lost control and will most certainly be sacrificed for their own personal gain. Ironic, considering I was supposed to be their queen. Depression is something I’ve always struggling with and also witnessed my partners struggling with.

"Hello. This is my first Reddit post so please ignore any mistakes.<br/>I, F14, am scared. Just yesterday my parents told me and my sister (not saying her age) that they were getting a divorce. My mom and dad constantly argued and disagreed a lot, so the news wasnt as shocking. Nonetheless, both my sister and I were sobbing uncontrollably.   Just recently Ive been in a deep depression and I lost all my friends so I was in a dark state. And because of that news, my mental health took an even bigger decline. I had a panic attack and just ran upstairs and cried and cried. I cried until I physically couldnt anymore. I felt (and still feel) numb.   My mom is scheduled to move out soon, which means my sister and I have to decide who to live with. For those who are curious; we will probably choose my mom because she is more finically stable. But my dad is still the most loving father ever.   My mom and dad told both of us that no matter who we chose that they will continue to love us. I have nobody to talk to because I have no friends, no therapist, and I feel uncomfortable talking about it to my parents. I am just stuck in the middle of nowhere. I dont know what to do, how to help them, and how this will affect my sisters and my future.   I want my normal, loving family back. But Im glad that this divorce is going to make my mom and dad happy. Though It doesnt make me happy. It makes me sad and alone, without anybody to cry on. Its just me myself and I.

The thing is, I’m a high functioning depressed adult. I don’t show or talk about my feelings. For example, this morning, I was dreaming about how I would die in peace in nature. I’m not suicidal but I do have thoughts about my own death, and why I have those thoughts. I have a good career, group of friends, and life in general. I just cannot unfuck this experience I have with myself: feeling alone in a room full of people, having nightmares about different things in my sleep that prevents me from good sleep, struggling to eat when I need to but having no problem to go and do things like working out, spending alone time, or spending time with others. I’m also dealing with being betrayed by two people I were close with in my life. I haven’t talked to one of them in six months. I haven’t talked to the other one in about two months. I love them both dearly and found it really painful to cut ties in order to establish boundaries for myself because I wasn’t ok with how they were treating me. I did this out of respect for myself but it’s so hurtful and puts me in a dark place thinking I don’t deserve anything. I cry alone in silence. I write my feelings in a journal. I read self help books. I don’t trust people. I do have friends but do keep them at a safe distance and don’t take my mask off out of fear of rejection and disappointment.

"This is my first post on this account, and I’m gonna start updating how I’m feeling on days I’m upset while I don’t have a therapist. Today I feel gross. I don’t usually have issues with my looks or feel bad about them but today I feel horrible. My boyfriend and I hung out yesterday and did a few things that made me insecure, though I know he didn’t mean to. He made a joke about something I did while being intimate which makes me really self conscious, and we always make jokes during that stuff but  one reason I waited so long to be intimate with someone was out of fear of being ridiculed, or being made fun of. So it triggered me but I didn’t wanna say anything. And then he saw my underwear later and saw the stains in them, which are natural from discharge. He didn’t make fun of it, he just pointed it out and asked but it still made me feel disgusting. And none of this really affected me too much until today, and I feel so bad about myself.  I saw him like some girls picture and his girl friend react to his bereal with a heart and it just made me feel even worse. Part of me has always felt like I’ll never be enough for someone. Like I won’t be pretty enough, I won’t be caring enough, I won’t be understanding enough, so however I can, I try to over compensate so I can be the only one for him. And I know it isn’t healthy for me but I’m just so scared I will never be able to please anyone. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally by someone, and never feel judged. I don’t think I’m ever going to be up to someone’s standards.  And if I am good enough, if I am loved, then I just wish I could somehow learn to love myself.",0,1,0,0

"A year ago, I lived in a big city with a desirable job in film and tv, lived with a close friend as a housemate, was independent and happy. Then covid happened, and 6 months later I had a nervous breakdown. I have a very troubled relationship with my mother and brother, with whom I am now no contact. I got diagnosed with C-PTSD from my childhood experience growing up under 2 narcissists. More and more, things triggered my anxiety and panic attacks, and I began to retreat from the world. I saw a psychiatrist, been on countless meds (now on 2 different antidepressants), had EMDR therapy for 3 months, yoga, meditation, did the Wim Hoff method for a month or so. Nothing seemed to stop the shrinking of my world. Now I’m 28, I live at home with my dad, no physical social life (albeit a strong friend support network via phone and online DnD campaigns), recovering from minor surgery, unemployed, and finding a 2-hour trial shift at a cafe so fatiguing I have to lie in bed for hours afterwards. My dad has shifted into a hard mindset to get me back out there, and I can understand where he’s coming from, but right now he’s the only person I physically see and I feel like this change has created distance between us, whereas before I could talk to him about anything, and I feel more alone that ever.  I feel like life is too hard and I’m not cut out for it. I feel weak. I feel like I’m being pulled into the black hole of being fated to never be a part of functioning society, to be one of those “crazy” people that never make it.

Literally no one knows what my dad does for work/ that my mom passed away 12 years ago.I dont work out anymore, dont play any sports. I was starting to gain muscle mass, now I just not fat.Heres the interesting part, a lot of my relatives say I look better than before and they are happy for me including people very close to me. During the last few years I have learned how I need to behave in order to seem perfectly normal, even ambitious. Ill have that fake smile, tell people we need to get in contact more, ask for advice to get the best possible job, seem interested in stuff like sports, pretend I spend a lot of time coding, never be the one who ends conversation.

However, my opinion of myself is absolutely horrible. I hate everything about myself and I can’t change it so basically, all I have is what others think of me. I’ve dedicated my life to trying to be nice, likable, funny, etc. but that’s just not me naturally and I don’t know how to pretend that it is. The hurt I feel from knowing how empty, short, and insignificant my funeral will be breaks my heart. I just want a friend. I just want anyone who will even just pretend that they like me. I feel like I wasn’t made for this world. I shouldn’t be here anymore",0,1,0,0

"Hi everyone,I hope youre all doing well. I wanted to reach out and ask if anyone has any experience with getting disability for depression. Ive been struggling with severe depression for most of my life, and unfortunately, I dont have any support from my family, nor do I have any close friends.My mental health has become worse since the start of the pandemic, and last fall, I had to quit my job because I couldnt handle it. My depression was causing me to have panic attacks and cry in the restroom during my shifts, and I didnt want to continue calling in sick. Im seeing a GP and a psychiatrist from Fraser Health and have been consistently taking my medication, but Im still struggling. Its challenging to function, and Im almost out of savings, so I need to find a job soon to avoid becoming homeless.Im doing everything I can to help myself, but Im finding it incredibly difficult. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and knows if its possible to get disability for depression. I apologize if this isnt the right forum to ask, but I thought Id give it a try.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any advice or support would be appreciated.",0,1,0,0

"Was recently diagnosed with cptsd, adhd and just a reinforced (or agreed upon) diagnosis of depression and generalized anxiety. I have an immediate family but theyre all fucked up themselves and theres no real sense of family within us. I basically raised myself from a young and until now, my early 20s. Life has always and continues to feel so unbelievably lonely. I have friends but they all come from families that do family shit and really love each other and they just can not understand the position Im coming from. Im in therapy, Ive been in it since I was 18 and theres been progress but I cant shake how lonely I constantly feel. There are days where I enjoy being alone but those days end in weeks of being so deeply lonely and craving human connection that I just cant find. The cptsd is a fucking beast and the more Ive learned about it more I realize that this is the main reason I feel so lonely and struggle with connection. I want a relationship, to be in love and experience happiness with another person and develop a community of my own so badly but Ive developed so many subconscious tactics to protect myself from these things and from being hurt I run myself in circles. No one in my life cant even begin to understand any of this when I try to explain it and it makes me feel insane. I bring it to therapy, I do the EMDR, the brains potting, talking about it but I feel stuck regardless. I really want things to come to a head and have this big break through but I feel like Im destined to be stuck with this and end up running or pushing away any opportunity to be close to someone. I cant help but feel kind of hopeless though. Anyways, if you made it this far, thank you and I hope you have a good week.",0,1,0,0

That was all fine until, at the end of the night, I was told he slept with a random new friend of a friend last weekend.

"I’ve been severally depressed over the past few weeks, my attention span has plummeted, my anxiousness has been riddled through every command I make, and by far the worst being I can’t enjoy music. I have various other posts regarding this topic, so I’ll leave it here brief and concise; Last year, a traumatic moment in my life had ultimately led to suicidal ideation, rough patches with my family, and overall melancholy. This had translated into what was seemingly my elusive OCD raining down upon me, of which I always pondered if I had OCD, but never quite dug beneath the surface and truly recognized how surreal and hellish the disease really is. I have now been hearing music differently, for example, accentuating merely the kick-drum or the snare pattern of a song and over analyzing these intricacies. Over analyzing TV, as an example, becoming aware to the fact that the camera cuts to camera to camera. This inadvertent infatuation I’ve had for the layers that build upon something that makes television and music alike has led to me feeling ultimately depleted from all the dopamine that once served me so. I’m no longer suicidal and I aspire to defeat this as well with other things that need retooling in my personal life, though this is the one that is giving me the most hell. If anyone could tell me what this, what to take for it, or even anyone wanting to chime in please let me know below. I appreciate it all, I just really want to fix this because even if I may not commit suicide or I have no intentions to, this OCD may very well destroy my life before I’d get the chance.

"I have dealt with mental health issues since I was a little girl, now that Im older and need to pay rent its becoming a big problem. I was a waitress for about 3 years, despite my growing social anxiety. Im proud of myself for doing as well as I did, but that job caused my depression and anxiety to become unbearable. I quit that job and started at a coffee shop inside of a hospital about a year ago. It was a wonderful change, I felt super safe in the environment, and it was 100% less stressful than waiting tables. Now, a year later, I have had a few coworkers that have made me feel extremely on edge. Even though the bad coworkers no longer work there, my brain has decided that it is an unsafe place. I dont enjoy the job as much as I used to because of how repetitive it is, and I have to wake up at 4:45am to be there by 6. I have to be one on one with my coworker all day, and that drains my social battery. Sorry this is so long, but basically I just need help finding ideas, and I guess also some support in the idea that I should change jobs? I feel like I failed because I dont like the job anymore.

"I’m a 23 y/o med student. Every big moment in my life is tinged with shame from something embarrassing I said or did. I just want to forget them all and I want everyone to forget me. I especially can’t let go of mistakes I made in undergrad. Every memory makes me feel sick to my stomach and ashamed to be alive. Women don’t drink in my culture and they especially don’t party with strangers, all of which I did in college. Some embarrassing moments also found their way onto social media where some of my friends and family saw them but my parents have no idea. They see me as the ideal daughter and cannot stop going on and on about how proud they are of me. I think part of the reason I want to be a doctor is so they have something tangible to be proud of and it’s not just my shitty facade of a good daughter. I’ve stopped the lying and drinking and I’m doing better in school now but I can’t shake off the shame from that time. I feel disgusted with myself for lying to them but I know it would hurt them even more if I told them. I also don’t want it to reflect their parenting because they have been nothing but perfect, loving, supportive parents my entire life.

"I (23m) have been single for most of my life, having only one “relationship” at 16 for a few months (She was reluctant to call it such at the time and afterwards told me she was just unable to find someone at the time). There have been a few other people I’ve been truly interested in since then but any time I show or admit my feelings for them things would always turn south fast. I know that being in a relationship is only one aspect of someone’s life and that there’s plenty to enjoy and many other people in my life who care about to where I shouldn’t need a partner to feel whole, yet I can’t help but think I need someone.

I’m at a point where I feel like there’s something actively wrong or repulsive about me because as far as I know no one has had any interest in me, and I even get bitter or depressed seeing happy couples because I genuinely feel I could never have it. I know being in a relationship won’t solve my issues, but whenever I hear people talk about “what makes them happy” or “what they strive/live for” they mention they’re relationships and I’d like to feel the happiness they do. Getting in a relationship feels like a big deal to me because I ultimately want to raise a family but not be too old to be disconnected with my kids, and every day it feels more and more like an impossibility.

Life is getting harder and harder, but I havent found an outcome to my current problem, but a new problem would pop out. Living is starting to become gray again for me. I thought Ive finally grown stronger and finally cured my depression on my own, but I guess I was wrong. I have no one to talk to about what Im feeling besides myself, thats why my coping words are things will get better But now, after not sleeping for 2 days straight. I ask myself, Do things really get better?",0,1,0,0

I’m over a year and five months clean, and I never thought it would happen. My progress hasn’t been linear, but eventually you can see episodes getting smaller and farther between.I’m so young and even when I feel like everyone would be better off without me, something keeps me here.

"Hi, I’m a 22 year old female I am in a part of my life where I feel like I’m a burden. I never saw myself living past 16 and always had thought on harm and my inevitable death. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, my mom didn’t believe in mental illness until my little brother showed signs of anxiety. I feel like she put his feelings above mine sometimes because I’m a girl.

I’m moving to LA soon for university and I want to be my true self. I guess I’m trying to ask for moral support, I don’t really care about what happens to me, I’m writing this thinking about how I’m a burden and people who know me must pity me or hate me because of how annoying I am. I obsess over things. I’m a bts fan and I know I annoy everyone with them. I’m only happy when I’m listening to their music. I’m sorry for my rant I’m just a person trying to find a point for living.

Partway through, I had to stop because I broke down crying. I havent been truly happy since the 80s and 90s. Now I know that this is nostalgia and rose-colored glasses for the carefree times of childhood.But even without that I really dont care for modern times. The style, the music, the movies dont speak to me. Then there is the general lack of hope that there seems to be. If I had to pinpoint a turning point, it would have to be 9/11. Something broke on that day (more than buildings), and it hasnt been fixed since. Theres no hope, just conflict. Conflict with others, conflict with ourselves. No light at the end of the tunnel or a goal for the conflict, just more conflict.

"He’s been depressed for a while. Like over a year. He’s completely changed. He’s no longer loving towards me, and doesn’t like to be around me. In the beginning of all of this he has been so hateful, and has looked at me with a lot of disgust. I have cried in front of him, only because the words hurt when he says mean things, but I have never held anything he has said over his head.  I love this man with every part of me, I have tried my best to be understanding, and give nothing but love during his hard times. I have felt so unwanted, unsure, and insecure of myself. Instead he avoids me because he says I make him feel sorrow. I don’t know what to do, I know I have lost myself, and I’m also depressed but I have to keep my feeling to myself. Otherwise I’m just making it about me. I do still take care of myself, I just have a hard time eating a lot of the time.

"relationship broke down months ago now, dont really have much recall of the time since then. Dont understand why it has hit me so hard. Guess its just been a reminder of the lack of impact I seem to have. Ive struggled mentally for years now and have tried everything under the sun to improve my mental health. Any progress is derailed in an instant due to my stupid brain. For just a moment life seemed pretty good then mentally my walls broke and I ruined something that was amazing. I know. Theres more fish in the sea, itll get better and easier with time. I know all of that. But knowing that doesnt change the outcome of the best situation Ive ever been in. And because of that, I just dont see a time where mental health wont ruin my life. Depression is a fucking monster. You think for a moment youve outrun it, then slowly it tears down your whole life around you while theres nothing you can do but observe. You try to find comfort in your hobbies only to find you gain nothing but lose everything. I dont claim to have had a difficult upbringing. I come from a loving family and have always had food on the table and a roof over my head. Ive had hardships, as has everyone. But regardless, I just cant fathom a life worth living and its been like that for 10 years. I lack the social skills to meet people, have no confidence in social situations but have a superiorty complex. I feel like an absolute lunatic mentally. My brain works way too fast and thinks way too much that I cant focus and just end up shutting down.

It kind of made me realize how I was much I am wasting my life because of depression and anxieties.I mean it didn’t fully fixed my depression or anxiety, but it definitely improved since then.

"About a month ago, my friend (who’s a clinical psychiatrist) and I were just randomly talking about how far we’ve come since high school.Challenges we faced and overcome. She mentioned the time were I was severely depressed during college days, I would cut or overdosed myself, drink until I passed out on the street. It was hell of a phased. During that time, I tried to get help. It didn’t worked for me. It was actually blank. I couldn’t even remember a thing during my session’s with my psychiatrist. All I know is that I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression.She told me that, sometimes, our brain can block a memory when it register an overwhelming trauma. Those sessions could’ve have been traumatic for me. But after those session’s, I told her, I was in a state of euphoria, I became numb, I couldn’t feel sad, heck I don’t even know what “sad” feels like. All I know what to feel is “happy”, every time something happens that I know for myself that would break me, I’ll just shrugged it off and smiles.That’s when she diagnosed me with clinical depression. Having feeling nothing, like seriously nothing, where life is completely meaningless. Can’t show any feelings other than a fake smile everyday. Also, how self aware of me with my mental illness. It would be hard to treat since I’m already in the last stage of depression. But I could still get therapy if I wanted to.Thanks for reading.",0,1,0,0

I am 34, I have no friends, never have had, I have a history of rejection, just rang my mum upset and she hung up on me after a few minutes.

ASD has caused burn out which leaves him constantly exhausted, so I do everything, this has meant we cant have kids yet and thats the only thing I ever really wanted. We are 7 and a half years together, he was never very affectionate and things have gotten worse and worse due to ASD burnout, we are trying one last attempt to treat it but it seems like it will never go back to a level I can cope with.

It’s not like I have a shit life or anything, I actually have a fairly good life, and other people think that too. I just don’t wanna live for those few happy moments if that makes sense. Like I’ll be happy for a moment, but that’s temporary. So are those few moments worth continuing? If it was me a long time ago, I’d say “yes” because I remember asking that to myself a few years ago.<br/>I’m tired, I wish time didn’t exist, and I don’t wanna grow up. I wish I could go back in time, when school wasn’t overwhelming, and when I didn’t have to worry about anything.

It’s just that when I have the time to do so, I have no motivation to do it because all I wanna do is absolutely nothing. I feel empty most of the time, but when I feel happy, I always end up feeling more sad than before. I wouldn’t kill myself, I feel like the only reason why I think that is because I still have that little hope in my mind that wants me to think that life is worth living, and everything will be worth it. But maybe deep down I know it isn’t and I’m just denying it? I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to find a reason to live, not in a depressing way though.

"For as long as I remember, I’ve always self isolated to cope with my negative emotions. Since being with people only makes me feel pressured to hide these emotions, since I don’t want to be the party pooper.However, obviously when I isolate myself, my mom gets mad at me because for some reason it makes her feel like I don’t love her?? As if I’m not self isolating for that exact reason - to not burden her with my feelings.I tell her I understand that she might feel that way but I’ve explained over and over again that it’s a way for me to cope without bothering anyone with negativity. That I do this just because I love her.She gets mad because she wants me to be able to lean on her, but it’s not like i feel comfortable doing that when she suggests it while acting angry towards me… I’ve tried explaining to her that I’m sensitive to a harsh tone, but she says she can’t help how she sounds (she’s very short-tempered and has a hard time masking her feelings).I just think it’s so hypocritical of her to say she cares about me but then not put the effort to change her behavior (being softer to and more patient with me but also being a better listener, since when I DO tell her about my negative feelings she just shrugs it off, like it’s not that big of a deal).I just wish she would tell me it’s okay to feel like i do and reach out a kind hand instead of just scolding me for “making her feel bad for not telling her”.

"Im sure many of you have experienced this feeling of being numb to it all. Nothing seems to phase you at the moment but perhaps the smallest gesture of kindness from a stranger could perhaps break you down. Right now I am feeling numb. Not putting effort into relationships anymore. Communication with friends has been breaking down but is it life or something I did? A question we will never get the answer to Im afraid. Is this what we have to look forward to? Will it truly get better? I want the person reading this to know I am full of love. People are deserving of love but it seems my love is dwindling and it isnt worth rekindling. I spend many hours watching reaction videos to sad things whether its movies, shows, music, or video games just to see people feel the emotion of sadness which results in them crying. When I watch those videos, I too wish I could cry alongside them but there isnt anything left inside me that allows me to cry. I think of people as reservoirs of immense love and unfortunately, through poor nurturing and no fault of their own, somewhere down the road, life shows them that their love is not good enough or worthy. I guess thats where I am. I dont like myself. Feels as though I am keeping my head above water daily treading water but some days its tiring.

I am starting to question whether not I even want a lot of what I desire. I am wonder if it even matters if I feel okay about myself, why does life have to pertain to the continuous existence of the attempt to self regulate in such a way to reach a  hypothetical ideal state of emotional wellbeing that most likely is just an idea made to give hope to a meaningless and more importantly irrational flux that is life. As soon as you find solid ground, it will crumble, as soon as you reach the goal at the top of the mountain, you become naturally apathetic. Why do I have to be okay? I don’t even know.

"Eating food is my way of self soothing when I’m nervous or upset. I am always binge eating or disordered eating cause whenever I feel down or anxious I gobble up a whole 100g choc bar or half a large nutella jar etc. I crave both sweet and savory and when I eat the food I feel a surge of emotion that distracts me from whatever negative emotion I am feeling in that moment.This pattern has been going on for years and happens the most late night when overeating helps me calm down and sleep.Today I hosted a small dinner with 3 guests only. Everything went great. I made my fav food and got some of my fav desserts in gifts. The guests left and I was left with a deafening sense of emptiness.  I just feel nothing tonight.My fridge is full of all the things I love to eat. Since I was a kid whenever the guests left I would excitedly eat the left overs later at night.

So I perceive this was not a fair environment, I believe some kind of rewards couldn’t be that bad when deserved obviously, could you imagine training dogs only beating them and never rewarding them?

He recently lost his long term best friend to cancer, and also lost both his high paying job and girlfriend (breakup) during the pandemic. His older brother is one of my closest friends, and his older sister is a friend of mine too. They are also having trouble trying to get him to be receptive to any form of communication. I have tried to keep a somewhat consistent pulse of reaching out to him. Every once in a while, he’ll reply (eg. I wished him happy new year, and he said “thanks brother”; I also sent him a selfie of myself and another friend of his one night with a caption of “what up” and he said “lmao you gems”I think I’m doing the right thing, but I’m afraid of being overbearing.

I am reaching out to this group for feedback on this overall situation. Am I being too much? I think he fears that I’ll say something to his brother.

"So I just got back from a week of dog sitting. The owner messaged me this afternoon asking about if I knew if one of the dogs injured himself, as he has a limp, wont sit up and wont get on their bed. I said I didnt know of anything happening. Now that I think about it he showed signs that something may have happened, and I was too stupid to pick up on them. About half-way through the stay he was whimpering a lot, and also wouldnt get on the bed. I figured he just missed the owner. I really did not notice any physical signs. I just feel so incompetent now that I let the dog be in pain for days because I just am terrible. I feel so guilty. I wouldnt blame them if they never asked me to pet sit again or even badmouthed about me to other people looking for sitters. I know the owner knows the dog better than me, and has better eyes than me to maybe know if something is wrong, but honestly after this I never want to pet sit again because of my lack of good observance when animals are under my care. this is leading me to not even want to live anymore.<strong>tl;dr:</strong> believe i made mistake pet sitting. dog was in pain for days. feel guilty and awful.",0,1,0,0

Actually, I felt relieved because I resented her for cancelling a dinner with me three times. First two times she had real excuses. Third time not at all. Im so resentful that Im happy for catching a flu.Her first reaction for me telling her Im sick was disbelief and suspicion. She thought Im lying to her. And why? Because thats her thing. She is so afraid to be assertive that she has to make up stories and excuses all the time. So, they tell me Im negative because Im depressed. I think Im just being realistic.

I agreed to slowing down, while trying to show her I was not planning on hurting her in anyway. I just continued to try and be thoughtful and good to her, but this just seemed to push her further away. Tonight we broke up, she said she couldnt continue to hurt me. She felt like shit because she couldnt be there in the relationship and she feels like she is meant to be alone because she is too fucked up. I feel like complete garbage, I feel dumb for trying so hard to make it work. I feel hopeless in finding someone, especially when this one felt so good. I know it sounds stupid but I really thought she was the one. We had so much in common and such a good connection. It makes me doubt my intuition, and makes me think Im destined to be alone.

When competing my pre-assessment, I say I suffer from depression. Thats when she came up with this question. I was appalled and offended, I could not believe someone was questioning the 15 years of survival mode I have been going through, the pain, the tears, the apathy, the lack of will to live...I could only answer that probably the fact that they offer medical treatment for it and it is a diagnosis makes it a medical condition, which is very real for somebody who has had to put up with it for half her life.Will probably look for another therapist next time.",0,1,0,0

This will be 13 years since my dad passed away and its still hitting me really hard. My dad was a Vietnam veteran he suffered severe ptsd and was very sick throughout my childhood years. He was the kindest and gentlest man Ive ever known. I learned early on about the stigma of people with mental illness as well as the stigma of Vietnam veterans. Its hard to explain what happened. Im not even sure what happened to this day. I obtained his military records and got few answers. One thing that stuck out was when he first got sick he was hearing voices telling him to kill himself. But he knew he didnt want to. So he always held onto that when he heard those voices. What messes me up the most is in the end he died of cancer that was a result of his military service in Vietnam. I guess in one way or another he was bound to be a casualty of the war. Im hoping to get through this week. Theres usually a lot of tears at this time. So I guess Ill just let them flow.,0,1,0,0

Why can’t I just be like them and why can’t I get better. I see no point anymore. There is no one in my life that understands me. All of the good relationships I have, I have grown apart from. No one genuinely cares about me. My parents have to because it’s an obligation to. I also have a cat and feel like I can barely put up with him or take care of him anymore because I’m such a mess. I never eat food unless I’m high. I care so much about my image on social media that I almost have panic attacks when someone unfollows me.",0,1,0,0
"This story is from last month. Being a kinda holiday (St. Paddy’s Day), my office closed down, so I decided to go get a haircut at my usual place. I’ve been getting my cuts routinely every month at said place since it opened (about four years now). When it first opened it did well, but post-COVID business had slowed due to a limited number of staff.Apparently they recently had a hiring kick, because I walked in to discover a full lobby, about six or seven folks working, and all chairs full. It was rather lively in there for once. I didn’t request a specific person, so my appointment was give to the next available. She was nice and chatted me up a tad. I normally remain pretty quiet during cuts, but will indulge if the stylist wants to talk.We connected a bit because we both agreed a previous client in another chair was continuously trying to flirt with her co-worker. The cut went on, shampoo and all, and then towards the end she hit with me, “You genuinely seem like a happy person.”I was taken aback, that’s the first time I ever heard something like that. I stayed quiet for a second, and then let out a fake laugh, along with, “I don’t know about that.”What she didn’t know was for the first time in my life I penned a suicide note on my phone the day prior. I’ve always thought about doing it throughout my life, but have obviously never acted on it. I don’t think I will, but these past few months have been tough and caused me to break down and actually put one together.I guess I’m good at hiding at.",0,1,0,0

"So Im going to therapy (CBT). And alot of my problems, apparently, stem from my negative thinking patterns. Well ok, I use the tools that I learn in therapy and implement it to remedy for this problem. So, everytime I do this it circles back to how much I hate my parents. I mean I care for them and love them and all but its a feeling I cant shake. I live with my parents and barely talk to my mom and stop talking to my dad. Im an only child with family members that dont check on me, except for one second cousin I have (but I was forced to raised her as my own child, long story). So, my point here is even with being able to challenge my negative thoughts my moods just seems to go in a spiral and goes back to one particular solution.  That solution is to move out! Deep down I feel like when I move out I will feel at least 80% better! You ask my Im still there, well, my moms disabled and Im in grad school so ya.So...Im asking for help.

"I want to preface this post with a quick note: I’ve been in a residential treatment program for a little over a year now, and during this experiment both Staff and my therapist where informed, you should absolutely not just stop taking your meds, even with professional supervision! This experiment was not one of my best ideas and I do not recommend recreating it!!! ————————————————————I’ve been on antidepressants since I was about 12 years old (I’m currently 19). A few weeks back I decided to talk to my therapist about quoting my antidepressant. My reasoning was based on the fact that a lot of my depression comes from my environment (or so I thought) due to the way my brain works. Thanks to a brilliant combination of Border Line Personality Disorder and very strong ADHD, my brain works a lot like a mirror, reflecting the situation I’m in onto my brain, heavily affecting how I feel and think. I’m actually still learning how BPD affects me, I only found out about it during the psychological evaluation during my intake to my residential program. I’m well aware most psychologists don’t like to diagnose BPD until at least 21, but due to the tests results she felt very comfortable in giving the diagnosis. My logic was ‘Since I’m in a healthy place mentally both mentally and physically it makes since that I would be less dependent on an antidepressant’.I was only a quarter correct. Yes it wasn’t nearly as bad as it had been a year ago but I still found my self having severe depression symptoms.I have since then decided I am staying on my meds.",0,1,0,0

I had the motivation to draw, something that I didnt do since a long time ago. I watched my favorite show. I was happy.

And I did it. This one hurted a lot more than the first time I did it, both physically and mentally. The biggest diference since the last time was that I did not feel any better. I was so fucking disapointed in myself that I could not look in my mirror again. I couldn´t stand to look at my legs full of bandages. I thought that it would be like last time, but not really. Only one person knows what I´m doing. She saw my scars accidentally, and asked me about it. I tried to make an excuse, and she didn´t mention it afterwards. I knew that she didn´t believe me.

I am diagnosed with depression and ocd. Yesterday I started feeling derealization - nothing new. I was walking to a date when out of nowhere I started realizing it was a Jewish neighborhood.

Then I went to the date but wasn’t feeling it so I ended it early. As I walked back I kept looking back to make sure the guy wasn’t following me back and I started questioning if he raped me when I was with him. Did I lose my memory? Did something bad happened that I can’t remember? Is this the present moment or am I imagining everything? I saw a barber shop.

Growing up I was the oldest of 12 kids. I took care of all of them mostly. I was also the first choice for a punching bag. My mom had me at 16yrs old and she was also a punching bag for my grandma. I know she had a bad life but now I’m suffering. Anyways in 2018 my aunty (who I took as a mom) passed away in December. Then my mom passed away in May 2019. Then my other aunty passed away Sept 2020. One after the other. I’m 30yrs old now and I’m suffering from depression. I feel like I’m drowning most days. I also have a daughter who’s 13yrs old now. I never once put her through what I went through. I would say I broke the cycle. I just started Reddit and got the urge to tell my story because I feel so alone. I feel like I don’t want to be here anymore. All the women in my life passed on and all my siblings either grew up and busy living their own lives or is to young and is staying with my step dad. I don’t see any of them as much as I should. I still feel like a kid no matter how hard I try to grow up. My mom was just starting to be nice and treat me like I’m something. My heart is broken. My daughter has family on her dad side but she’s more attached to me. A lot of the time I wish I could just leave this world. Just go without any guilt but I find that’s what’s keeping me here. Im working with a therapist full time and been on multiply antidepressants growing up. I still suffer from nightmares. That fear is still embedded deep into me.

"Need to get this off my chest, maybe someone relates:<br/>Ive always been the one who gets joked with in the friend group. I havent made a friend in 7 years, i feel like people dont like me after ive gotten really depressed and have social anxiety, even family doesnt seem interested in me even tho i try to open up and talk and be kind. Its like i have zero energy in the body, like my soul is stripped from me and people sense that. I have no energy to give. I thought it was porn who messed with my brain, but i realize i even had anxiety as a child and depression. Im pretty sure i have a chemical imbalance in the brain, i have good parents and have no trauma. Besides the fact that i cant connect with anyone really, and that i have social anxiety - i rarely feel emotions. i cant fall in love anymore. I dont find things very pleasurable anymore, i easily get bored. If i didnt have my family i would have been long gone by now, but i still have a little hope for my future. Microdosing is my first step, if it doesnt work ADHD meds which im pretty sure is tied to my brain chemistry issues. Dont even know what this rant is - for everyone who is feeling this way, you are genuily not alone. My whole life i have never really been happy, only for a few years and as a very young child. I feel like my brain is legit ruined and my spiritual body is ruined, people take advantage of that. Earth is extremely hard to me to live on, i hate it here so much - but i also realise it can be a nice place if i had that brain chemistry, had that joy, had that energy.

"I use to love cooking, especially when I cook for someone else or a group of people. I still feel that I like cooking or I want to think I do. Recently Ive been having some difficulties when it comes to eating. Especially when I really put effort into it. Im good to it, and I use great ingredients (healthy nd fresh) and use well known chefs instructions. When I start eating its fine, until I start thinking (over thinking) WHT Im eating. Then I get nauseous or completely put off. Wtf is wrong with me, or is there anyone who has the same experience..?

"Having a silent Mental break down is when you live with the people that abuse the shit out of you and have gaslighting as an hobby. I am having that rn and its nothing new. If you are in a situation where you wana break down but not in front of people (which I hope your never there). Do what I do which is, go to a room that you are sure you can be alone in for 5 minutes minimum, think of it, cry a little as quietly as possible, make sure your eyes dont get red enough that its noticeable, and get out of the room rubbing them if you know that somebody standing outside. Repeat till you feel like your phone can distract you again. And it is hard. Im typing this rn after doing that more than 3 times.I wana tell my close friends but as any other depressed person, I feel like a burden. I do feel like they are tierd of hearing my sob storys even tho they are amazing people and I am very aware its not true. This feeling will never stop. Anyways.... Before I go in a loop hole...

"I love how I’m looked down upon by my family. I’m 22 and take care of one of my physically disabled parents. Through most of my teen years, Ive paid for $18,490 of my own college tuition. That’s including books, the classes and every material I need for my classes. I was laid off from my factory job and have been applying for nursing or training cna jobs since that’s what I’m trying to get my degree in. From that, I do my classes, take care of my parent as well as an autistic sibling on the lower end of the spectrum, clean, cook and get other necessities. My “sperm donor”(father) has always judged me. I don’t have my license because of my family’s financial status, I either pushed my way to school or buy a car. I went with the latter and chose education. Well, I don’t have a license so every job I got id bike or take public transport to my jobs. Everything I do to take care of my family my father sees it as nothing. He’s a damn hoarder that sits on his ass and only cares about his next meal. It hurts because he’s done nothing but judge me. His family makes fun of my weight, calls me lazy, insults the way I look and sees me as a disappointment compared to my sibling. It just angers me that he chooses to target me and make me feel like I’m trash. At this point I just feel emotionally numb to being treated like I’m just a maid. I just hate everything with my family life. I’m trying to get help with my license as I’m doing back to back human anatomy classes, taking a math final, trying to get a job and just trying to take care of my body physically. I just feel like I’m close to having a breakdown from all the things I’m doing. I just am trying not to cry or let things get to me.",0,1,0,0

No I don’t believe that I don’t believe I’m deserving of love at all I’m not in a position in life to deserve love. Put simply im a failure todays my 19th birthday and I just got my first job working at a fast food restaurant a few months ago, I have no friends and live with my parents, who are very strict and still treat me like a child im failing everything in school and will have to come back and do an extra year of high school to graduation. Idk what my point is in writing this im kinda just explaining how much of a failure i am. But basically I’ve come to the conclusion that no one will love me and that’s not really something to complain about life is still pretty good just existing my life does seem to be going nowhere and im terrified about the future but the window im sitting in front of has a nice view and I guess at a certain point you have to except life for what it is. I really don’t know if im making sense now but anyway people live for today and all that shit try to find friends if you can I can’t but I might be able to online mabye that’s why im posting this idk im crazy and make mo sense and if you’ve read this far you probably are too so ummmm love ya all.",0,1,0,0

"Hi. Never posted here before. I checked the rules and hopefully this doesnt break any. Ive been depressed for a really really long time. I had a really intense trauma happen about 5 years ago and Ive been repressing it for the 5 years. It finally reached its boiling point and I cracked a couple days ago. I had to call out of work early, I had a anxiety attack that put me on the floor for the first time in 5 years, and I called my therapist in desperation. I went in for a therapy session early (I go once a week on Fridays)  and it was a really fucked up couple of days after that.The point is, I wouldnt be around at all if I didnt have that therapist. Ive been too weak mentally on my own. I dont know any of you, but maybe you are too weak to hold yourself up as well. Ive been in therapy for 4-6 months and on meds for 1-2 months. &#x200B;The thing is, I put therapy off for all of these years and I should have just called 5 years ago. Maybe I thought I was strong enough, maybe I thought I should just be a man, maybe I just hate making phone calls. I dont know. I just want to tell you guys, once I made the call the rest was easy. I signed up, found a therapist I liked to talk to, and dumped A LOT of that trauma. If you are having your insides torn to shreds like I have been, go. get. a. therapist.Thats all.

No matter how hard I try to tell someone how messed up my mind is. I cant.

"Everyone wants a good nights rest. The feeling of getting into fresh sheets, putting your head on the pillow, and immediately drifting off without any worry or stress. To know a good nights rest means you wake up at the right time no matter how many hours you need. There is no urgency and there are no expectations. When you awake you are gently greeted by the warmth of the day. You can breathe in deeply and feel the oxygen nourishing your cells awake. Everyone wants to feel the light and cozy blanket that protects us. It protects us from harm like a tent from the rain. It comforts us at all times. It keeps our bones warm so we can stand tall instead of shivering in the cold. Even when we think we don’t need it, the blanket is like house keys or a wallet, an essential piece we cannot leave the house without. It may also be something we can extend to others when they need it and we‘re doing ok. I do not always feel this way, but I would like to put it in writing to remind myself that I can be one less cruel, cold, tortured person in the world. I do not have to give back to the world what I receive if it is heartless and lonely. I can put my head on my pillow and allow myself rest. I can go outside and allow myself to feel peace.

Just complete apathetic detachment.What terrifies me is that this “thing” will never go away. I can manage it. I can organize my life around it. But I’ll never truly be rid of it.

I feel like it is all pointless, that probably this friendships will end eventually and I will never be able to pass my exams and become a doctor.

"I need to preface this by saying that I am with someone, and I am safe. I am ok just need a place to vent.The only reason I am alive is because there are so many people who rely on me. I don’t say that in a nice way or in a way that it gives my life meaning, but in a way that if I did end it, they would be lost. In between uni, being the sole provider for the household (in this economy :/ ), raising my younger sister, and being the emotional support for literally everyone in my life, I am spread so thin. I think what hurts is that no one can see or hear the pain I am in. I feel like I cant ask for help because I truly think they don’t care, they don’t ask, and they don’t even bat an eye. Everything is getting too much, and I have reached my breaking point. I went for a walk to try and boost my mood and get some sun, there’s a walking track near my house but the speed limit is 100 km. I walked for 90 minutes trying to convince myself that its going to be ok and I have so much to live for, while the other half of my brain was telling me just to fling myself in front of a car. I probably wouldn’t survive that, and at this point, anything would be better than the pain that I feel. &#x200B;Im ok and Im contacting my therapist",0,1,0,0

"I have no confidence in anything I do, I have to do what I’ve been guided or told to do because any decision I make goes wrong or wasn’t the right one in the first place. I’m not talking about major decisions here but over the course of my life each mistake and poor judgment chips away at me and it makes me feel worthless. The only right decision I’ve ever made is meeting my wife and having a child together, if it wasn’t for my family I don’t think I would be here anymore. I often feel alone, I no longer have friends due to my social anxiety and the fact I’ve always been awful at keeping in contact with people. Whenever I try to talk to old friends again it never goes anywhere further than a few messages. I work an every level job and have no drive to climb any higher because the idea of responsibility scares me. I am always worried that I’d do something wrong or that something bad would happen under my responsibility. I have struggled with anxiety and depression in the past and I guess I’m back in that hole again, I don’t want to tell my wife about it and I seem to be masking it well at times.

That made it hard for me to fit in with anybody else and make friends with people that were my age. Thinking about it just makes me want to cry, knowing that I can never redo any of that or ever experience regular school again.

Group 1 fell apart because I moved countries. Group 2 fell apart because of people preferring my ex and his friends to me. I’ve had close calls with friendships since then, but it’s usually promptly countered by them having group chats excluding me and/or there being someone in the group who already decided they don’t like me. The only friend I have is my boyfriend who argues with me constantly nowadaysMy intelligence is mid or even below average for my field (compsci). My only  strong point is I can fake an attractive social style to seem smart/funny for a few minutes for interviews etc. It’s coming to exam season and I am completely burnt out. I went to only 3 lectures for the entire spring semester because of social anxiety, being nocturnal and going home to get babied by my parents oftenOnly things I enjoy nowadays is spending time with my parents, consuming nicotine and having driving lessons with my parents. I can’t do anything typically entertaining like playing video games or watching tv because I feel overwhelming guilt about my degree and all the goals I’ve set for myself that I’m not achieving Everyday I am just so angry my life turned out this way and I feel like an overgrown child.",0,1,0,0

"My (34m) ex wife (26f) left me after 6 years together out of the blue and never really explained why. We have a daughter together, we survived two major accidents, and COVID together and while we had issues, we always made up and helped each other.In June of 22, she asked me to take a loan out to help her sort her debt, which I did after asking her if we were ok and no issues to which she said yeah we are perfect. In mid August if that month she came to me and said she wasnt happy and wanted to separate for a bit, this was a shock to myself and our entire family. I suggested maybe we try some counciling first, She agreed to this originally and then after a week said she just wanted to go herself and talk to her therapist, after her first session she asked if we could go to dinner and talk and thats when she told me her head and heart said different things and she wanted to take a break to work it out, I was devastated but agreed to try and work it out for our daughter. Come start of September, 2 weeks after we split I find out shes been seeing another guy from her work that she apparently has been talking to and flirty with for the past year. Start of October she has this guy moved into her new place and introduced our daughter to him, after both of us agreeing it was too soon she did it anyway. I asked her if she left me for this guy and if she had been having an affair to which she denied. I asked her if we could sit down and just talk about why it fell apart to which she said it just didnt work out, that she shouldve maybe tried harder but we both had faults, never really explaining why she had sudden change of heart. Even her family had no idea it was coming and everyone thought we were happy.

"So a bit of backstory to this...Im 39 years old and have struggled with mental health concerns my entire life.  Depression, anxiety...even both borderline and avoidant personality disorders.  Oh, and another key one - gender dysphoria (transitioned over 5 years ago).  Im waiting until I have my final gender-confirming surgery in a few months before I actually go through with this, but my mental health has deteriorated badly over the past few months to the point where Im tempted to check myself in to a psychiatric ward.  I can feel myself slipping away more and more (dissociative episodes have increased lately), cant sleep, cant eat, and just generally feel checked out on most things.Ive even told my therapist that I feel I have nothing to live for, and thats very much true.  I hate my family, have very few friends, and have been single for quite a long time.  So, imagine carrying this weight all by yourself for so long.  While Im definitely not actively considering anything like suicide, I know that if something were to happen to me, I probably wouldnt even care.  Like, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and feel alright with it.  Doesnt mean I plan to run out into traffic or anything, ha, but hopefully my point is clear enough.  Multiple times over the years Ive considered checking myself in to one of the inpatient psychiatric care facilities here where I live.  I only put it off because in order to be cleared for my surgeries, I had to avow to not having ever done so previously.  Now that this barrier is about to go away...might soon be time.I guess my question here is...if I were to do so, what should I expect?  Like, how long would they hold me/could I voluntarily leave if I wanted to?  What generally happens to patients in these situations?

My life right now is nothing to complain about really Ive got it in order pretty good. It hasnt always been though and thats where the depression came from. Now I thought I overcame my suicidal tendencies pretty well even if i felt depressed every once in a while. Then came yesterday where I found out i was in fact not over it and apparently i had been bottling up that shit and it rubberbanded me right over the edge. I had a moment of relaxation because i had cleared a big hurdle and in that moment of relaxation everything caught up to me. I was dangerously close to overdosing on my meds and I dont know what to do. Nothing was wrong but the thought of doing it was so freeing. I was sitting there laughing of all things. When my heart startet aching I smiled. After that moment i was aware more than ever before that depression is in fact an illness not to be taken lightly.Can someone help with this. Tf do i do?

I was friends with this person for years. My heart is just broken. I feel so terrible about myself now. I know I have people that love me and would communicate problems with me, but this situation has made my depression so much worse and has made me feel like I’m not worthy of being cared about.

"&#x200B;Im 22 years old. I am 53. I have been in relationship one time. She left me, without any answer or reason given to me. Since then its been almost, 7 or 8 years i have been single. I was depressed when i was 17 ( almost turning 18). I wanted to die but couldnt find any easy way to do it. Since then loneliness hunts me everyday. I go to college just to see other people and feel less lonely. I been trying social media, club and everything to get into relationship but it feel like no girl likes me. Everytime i see a couple, it kills me, i think it is because of jealousy. Specially my mood changes, i feel deeply sad and just want to be alone and dont want to live. Nowdays i have been going to work and college. I just work in a warehouse somedays and i just do the work because i want to keep my mind busy. Everytime i have free time, i feel alone. I wish everyday why god gave me this life. I wish i was never born. I dont know what future holds for me, this loneliness never leaves me. I am also little bit porn addicted, by this i keep my sexual desire to myself. I feel hopeless, broken but it seems like there is no other option for me. I think main reason for my depression was my height and i thought nobody likes me because of it. I tried therapy, it worked but still now I feel a dead men living a life.I hate my family aswell. I never liked my father, he left me ealry but we starten living toghter since i was 14, turns out he is alcoholic. After school i never wanted to return home because of him. Now my mother is also depressed. I have a big sister but im not close with her. By the way im was never close with anyone.

The big thing to understand is that he was a major reason for my depression and now that were talking again, I somehow feel worse. I get super clingy and whenever he leaves or especially hangs out with somebody else, it pretty much makes me suicidal and puts everything in doubt for whatever reason. Ive become much more sensitive to things too, Even things that are clear jokes. I really dont know what to say aside from that I feel trapped.

The reason is that it seems like a lot of work.&#x200B;I dont want to own a house or fancy car. I know most people wont own both or even one of these things but at least they strive and try to achieve these goals.&#x200B;I dont feel like hanging out with my friends.

"So to start out I just want to say I’ve been suffering from severe depression for most of my life. I grew up with no parents, no self confidence, and extreme social anxiety. I’ve been through all the stages over these long years, sadness, anger, loneliness, etc. Slowly though, those feelings have kind of died out. Now I don’t really feel anything or have motivation to do anything. It’s no longer a sadness or longing. I just exist. The only reason (it’s been the only reason for a long time) that I don’t commit suicide is because I have a couple family members that I don’t want to make sad. That being said, I’m pretty sure that’s how my life will end once I don’t have them in it anymore. I don’t even feel emotional about saying that or scared to do it, it’s almost like stating an inevitability that doesn’t really bother me. I have no ill feelings towards anyone and the last thing I’d ever want is for anyone to be burdened or hurt by me or the things I do. I consider myself a decent person overall, I just want to disappear one day and let everyone else continue their lives. So if anyone makes it far enough to read this whole thing, is there a way to fix this feeling? To find happiness or a reason to exist? I just feel like maybe my time would be better spent if I had a goal. Right now it’s just kind of like im staring at a clock, doing the bare minimum to exist, and waiting for time to come to me.

"Ive just realised how lonely I am now. This past year, I think Ive left my house for a social interaction other than work, maybe 5 times at most. Multiple times a week Ive asked people who I thought were my friends to hang out, but Ive always been turned down or offered an excuse.I never had a close group of friends growing up so I would jump around different groups whenever I could. As time went on, I had less and less groups to spend time with, and it devolved into a very small handful of people.This past year, I have really come to terms with how little my friends care about me. No one starts conversations, they barely reply, Im constantly turned down on offers to hang out and many people have taken advantage of it.I used to think that a smaller circle would be good for me, as I never had many friends growing up. Now that Im here, and my circle is just me and my cat, I dont think Im too upset or annoyed. I think things will be just as shit without them so Im giving up on having friends. I have come to terms with the fact that my life has been going downhill since I could formulate a thought and its never getting better. I would rather die alone and live a miserable life than put anymore energy into connecting with people that dont give a fuck about me.",0,1,0,0

"Hello everyone, recently i have been prescribed Rexulti(brexpiprazole) which I am taking with Wellbutrin(bupropion). Wellbutrin is strong CYP2D6 inhibitor and brexpipirazole is metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Studies have shown that combining the two medications increase brexpiprazole concentration twice. Brexpiprazole half-life is 91 hours and according to Wikipedia steady state is reached in approximately 12 days. My question is will inhibiting CYP2D6 double the half life of brexpiprazole from 91 to 182 hours and its time to reach steady state from 12 to 24 days or steady state will be reached in the same time frame. Will reaching Cmax will be delayed? I am asking this question because my doctor said that steady state should be reached in 2 weeks and therefore i should feel the effects around that timeframe. Thank you in advance!",0,1,0,0
"Basically where I live (New Zealand), the mental health systems really stretched so you can only get help if you’re a constant danger to yourself or other people. Due to my younger age, my doctor (who is amazing btw) really doesn’t think it’s a good idea to be taking medication at my age. Fair enough. I can see that shes trying to look out for me physically too. I’ve tried to get private care but it’s WAY too expensive, I’m already getting benefits from the government just to put food on the table so paying for private is out of the question.The health insurance companies in NZ wont cover for mental health mainly because I suffer from PTSD so mental health is a pre-existing condition. I’ve tried helping myself by keeping my head up, setting goals and generally trying to keep myself happy/distracted from whats going on.I’ve also tried methods linked with CBT to help keep my emotions regular which has worked but no matter what I try I just cant shake the empty, unmotivated and straight up miserable shit inside me.

"Originally from Texas, I relocated to Indiana to attend Indiana University as a freshman last August. I was accepted into the Kelley School of Business, majoring in finance (ranked 7th nationally), but later decided to switch my major to computer science with a concentration in software engineering (ranked 55th nationally). This change led to a slight delay, and now I need to take some community college classes during the summer. I would describe my computer science skills as slightly above average.My initial plan was to study finance at a prestigious institution, paving the way to top finance jobs. However, Im now pursuing tech at a school not renowned for its tech programs.As an out-of-state student, my tuition for this year was around $52k ($24k covered by a scholarship), and I genuinely want to return to Texas to attend community college and later transfer to UT Austin for either computer science or aerospace. However, Ive already invested a significant amount of money, and almost none of my credits would transfer, leaving me feeling stuck here and nauseous knowing that If I choose to go to community college, Ill have to explain to my family that the $52k spent was ultimately for nothing.If I decide to stay, I feel like Ill need to work extremely hard this summer to improve my programming skills, find a tutor, create an impressive portfolio, all while holding a full-time job and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

I have friends, family who say they can support at any moment, but I cant, I cant ask for help, Im ashamed, they took me to the doctor when I was On the brink of s*cide Until recently, I did not believe that it was possible to cure me, and these thoughts still visit me. I have been on treatment for 3 years now, and in the last year I got worse. Why ? I dont know, doctors cant diagnose it, it doesnt look like depression anymore, but it doesnt look like bipolar either. I just feel bad at a certain moment, and it doesn’t depend on anything, I just wake up and feel bad, morally. This is killing me. Not only does my mood change, but so does my behavior, uh. Formerly sociable the cheerful self has become an unreal, useless vegetable.Why am I embarrassed to ask for support? I just think people have their problems in bulk, they are busy now when I try to start a dialogue about something. People like the sociable joyful me, not this semblance ...I just dont want to disturb them again, but Im so lonely, Im lonely as hell in these moments, and here I am. I could say something like I do not need pity or support, but I need, no matter how humiliating it may sound, I pray for the help of the Internet, thanks to everyone who read this post.",0,1,0,0
I always lose. Every. Single. Time. Nothing good for you. Just blackness.  Its dark. Just be. Thats all you can do. The dark nowhere. There is no point to my life. I will never be liked. I will never be loved. Just keep swimming lil honu. Just keep swimming. Until you cant anymore. I wont blame you when you cant anymore. I will just drown. I wont have many good memories. Mostly pain. Rejection. Loneliness. Yay. At least I can still feel... even if it is pretty awful.,0,1,0,0
"Hi. I turned 15 this year. In January I walked to the subway near me and I imagined being ran over. I do not think death is the soloution but an escape and sometimes I really want to escape who I am. Today my Dad got slightly upset I started bawling and told him I am going for a walk. I did it again but this time I tried to get off the fence. I would jump if I could, right? I am not sure. I dont want my Dad to feel guilty but at the same time I do. But I do this to myself. I feel so dissconected from the world. I am an outcast. I can never fit in. I am awkward and lame. I want my past back. I was happy but I ruin everything. There are cons and pros to everything but I was most happy with my friends. But now everyone seems like they have a purpose. They have a reason to live but I do not. I do not see myself living past my twenties. I feel so hopeless and lonely. I can not even open up when I have the chance with counsulors in fear they will judge me or be concerned. I dont want concern. I want to leave this place. I want someone to listen. I feel so exhausted but I am a faliure. I hate my name. I hate my personality. I hate the way I cant pronounciate anything my voice is ugly. I am ugly. I am judgemnetal and pessimistic. I am a monster. I am overly sensitive. I dont wanna be me anymore. I feel as if I was gone everything would be the same. I dont affect anything. I am not of importance.",0,1,0,0

"Because of moves I never had any friends since age 6 or 7, and I think that broke me. I’m pretty much mute at this point because I’ve had so few conversations, when I do talk I have a terrible stutter that makes it hard to speak. I could cope if at least one positive thing came out of all that, but all depression has made me is really really stupid. I can’t think straight and I get confused really easily. I’m such an empty shell of a human being I have nothing to talk about. No hobbies. I’m just waiting to die.",0,1,0,0
"Burner account. I’m typing this about an hour after getting off work and walking in to find my husband passed out on the couch next to one of his loaded handguns. I’m really shaken up and don’t know what to do now. I immediately moved the gun away from him and checked on our kids (they are fine, sleeping soundly in their beds) and I called his mom. it’s all I could think to do. I moved the gun to our garage by her recommendation and hid it in a bucket, I have no idea if the safety is on or how to take the bullets out, I just wanted it hidden from him. I’m still shaking and I don’t know what to do now. I can only assume what his intentions were and I don’t know how I’m supposed to go to sleep while my mind is racing like this. This past year he has been struggling with depression and alcohol abuse, it’s been a constant struggle but he’s been making improvements I thought. These last 2 weeks especially he has been so open and communicative about his thoughts and feelings and we’ve been on a really great upswing I thought.He’s too drunk to speak with right now, so I’ll have to approach him in the morning but I’m so shaken up…. What do I do?",0,1,0,0
"Im sorry if my post is all over the place, I just finished having an anxiety attack...My partner (19M) and I (18M) have been together for a year and a half, our relationship has been one with many ups and downs, the mayority of them due to my family. We love eachother so much but my intrusive thoughts dont let me believe it fully. To not make the text huge, these months have been horrible for me. Im autistic and suffer from anxiety and depression. My parents have been making my life hell because theyre extremely religious and Im not cisgender or straight. I still live with them so I have to put up with them. My school principal hates me, I sometimes have issues with my friends, I hate my body since Im fat and all of this have been making me really angry towards everything and everyone. Im tired of being like this but I cant stop, I dont know how to... My boyfriend works and takes me to dates all the time but he also is tired from work so I want to be in the best mood to receive him but I just cant... Ive been having suicidal and self harm thoughts, and even if he says he wont,  Im sure hell eventually will have to let me go if I stay like this. I love him so much and I dont want this to happen, I want to be better but all I do is hate everything and myself. I feel like Im such an ungrateful human being for being like this to him, all sad, angry and having panic attacks with him, is it that I expect him to make me feel better? All I wish is to heal and get out of this house so I can be in a place where Im actually loved. He is the only one that I can trust in, and Im not exaggerating, he literally is the only one I can blindly trust. TL:DR Im having sh and suicidal thoughts because of many aspects that are fucking up my life right now and its affecting every single aspect of myself. Im afraid it will eventually ruin my relationship.",0,1,0,0
"Two days ago I (m15) confessed to my parents that I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day. My stepmother told me not to do it near my little gifts please and my fathers reaction which still leaves me speechless; he reproached me for saying such a thing, my parents have it hard enough as it is. - well, hes been ignoring me ever since My parents are a lousy bunch of shit - my opinion :]",0,1,0,0
Cause I really just gotta admit it-- nobody has ever said theyve really loved me. Nobody has even been affectionate or really acknowledged Im there. Nobody will ever love me no matter how hard I try. And I cant fucking change it. I am so goddamn lonely all the time and nobody cares. Im so tired of trying to figure it out myself. Im so tired of being alone all the time. I dont know how Im gonna do anything. I just keep pushing down my feelings and I cant admit it but I gotta- nobody loves me. Nobody will ever love me and I will always be alone. I hate this.,0,1,0,0
"It is nearly impossible for me to work full-time with depression. I am constantly anxious, exhausted, irritable, and full of anguish. The best way I can describe it is with a distance-running analogy. Simply completing my daily tasks--even the act of moving forward through time itself--is like progressing through the miles of a marathon. You wear down mentally and physically and continue to decline until the race (or life) is over. In a marathon, however, you can get rid of the pain by stopping. In life, you cant, as this would mean ceasing to live.Not a perfect analogy, but Im feeling terrible tonight and this is my best shot at describing it.",0,1,0,0

"Years ago, I put a knife to my chest, and my heart beat faster than ever. I was scared of the effect, but at least the suicidal ideation gave me some kind of feeling of actually wanting to be alive.I was always proud of myself knowing that even in what I felt like were my darkest times, I wanted, and took necessary steps, to get better. Tonight, I went knife-to-chest again, yet felt nothing change. My body didn’t react. My composure equaled that of me eating dinner or watching television.I have all the support around me I could possibly need, too. Everyone (myself included) has done everything they possibly can to help me get over this. Executing the desire doesn’t scare me anymore.",0,1,0,0
"I just wake up, sit in my computer chair until its bed time, then I fall asleep. Im only even awake for 10-12 hours in a day, sometimes even less. All I want to do is crawl in bed and sleep because I dont even have enough motivation to be able to do something as simple and small as sitting in my chair with a source of unlimited entertainment.Ive been writing in my journal more lately, a lot of my thoughts, but it always keeps regressing into me writing the same sentences over and over and over again.Nobody will ever love me.Ill always be alone.I struggle moving on from things. My ex-fiance left me almost 3 years ago and I still think about her every day. I wonder if Ill always think about her - the only time Ive ever felt loved in my entire life was when I was with her, even though she secretly resented me almost the entire time we were together. The best Ive ever been was intolerable to the only person who ever even bothered to say that they loved me - even though they didnt.Im always alone and nobody will ever love me.",0,1,0,0

"So I went to my therapist today. Her mission for me this past week was to journal my thoughts/feelings/mood swings, to help her get a better handle on my rollercoaster mental state. I sent them to her daily. Today, she recommended inpatient treatment, as she can’t prescribe meds, and she sees that I need more intensive help to deal with depression/suicidal thoughts. I don’t know what that looks like, or what is involved. I would appreciate anyone’s stories/ insights. Tyvm",0,1,0,0

I honestly just want to end it. I hate living. Every time I think about my life my heart hurts. I hate myself so much. I wish I was normal. I actually can’t take it anymore. It’s a shame… I actually finished college and got a job too. I hope my parents don’t miss me too much,0,1,0,0
